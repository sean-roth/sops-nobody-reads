## Revenue Streams (Evolving)

| Stream | Stage | Price Point | Status |
|--------|-------|-------------|--------|
| Custom modules | Now | $1,500 - $10,000+ | Active |
| Free giveaway modules | Soon | $0 (lead gen) | Planned |
| Essentials subscription | Future | ~$29-99/mo | Idea |
| Self-service tool | Future | $99-299/mo | Vision |
| White glove service | Future | Premium | Vision |

## Free/Essentials Module Library (Ideas)

Universal modules every company needs:

| Module | Industry | Why It's Universal |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| Handwashing | All food service, healthcare | Health code requirement |
| Fire Extinguisher Use | All | Insurance/OSHA |
| Workplace Harassment Prevention | All | Legal compliance |
| Cybersecurity Basics | All | Insurance increasingly requires |
| Slips, Trips, Falls | All physical workplaces | #1 workplace injury |
| Emergency Evacuation | All | Required for most businesses |
| Bloodborne Pathogens | Healthcare, tattoo, cleaning | OSHA requirement |
| Food Allergen Awareness | Food service | Legal liability |

**Strategy:**
- Build these for practice and portfolio
- Give away free (no email gate) to build trust
- Offer as subscription bundle for small businesses ($29-99/mo for access to library)
- Include 12 months free access with every custom package (added value)
- Each one is a case study for Claude to learn from

## Vertical Opportunities (Watch for patterns)

As we work with clients, track which industries show up repeatedly:

| Vertical | Signals to Watch | Specialization Potential |
|----------|------------------|-------------------------|
| Restaurants/Food Service | High turnover, food safety reqs | "The restaurant training company" |
| Healthcare/Clinics | HIPAA, compliance-heavy | Audit-proof training |
| Cannabis | Fast-growing, heavily regulated | State-specific compliance |
| Construction | OSHA, equipment certs | Safety-focused |
| Property Management | Onboarding, fair housing | Multi-location consistency |
| Professional Services | Client onboarding, SOPs | Knowledge capture |

**Decision point:** After 10-20 clients, identify if 40%+ come from one vertical. If yes, consider specializing.

## Self-Service Tool Vision (SOPtoSCORM.com)

**The dream:**
- User uploads SOP/handbook
- AI analyzes and structures content
- User reviews/edits outline
- AI generates full module with quizzes
- User exports SCORM package
- Done in hours, not weeks

**Technical components needed:**
- Document parsing (PDF, Word, etc.)
- Claude API for analysis and content generation
- Module builder interface
- SCORM packaging automation
- Preview/testing environment

**Pricing model:**
- Free tier: 1 module/month, basic features
- Pro: $99/mo - unlimited modules, priority processing
- Business: $299/mo - team features, API access, white-label

**Moat:**
- Prompt library tuned from hundreds of real client projects
- Industry-specific templates and patterns
- Quality that DIY tools can't match because we learned from custom work

## Data & Insights Strategy

### The Opportunity
Every client SOP we process teaches us:
- Industry-specific terminology
- Common compliance requirements
- Effective quiz question patterns
- What works for different audiences

### Legal/Privacy Considerations (TODO)
- [ ] Terms of Service that allow anonymized learning
- [ ] Privacy Policy covering document handling
- [ ] Client consent for case study use (anonymized)
- [ ] Data retention and deletion policies
- [ ] Clear communication about AI usage

### What We Want to Capture (Anonymized)
- Industry vertical
- Document type (handbook, SOP, policy, etc.)
- Original length vs. final module length
- Number of learning objectives
- Quiz question types that work
- Revision patterns (what clients change)
- Completion rates (if clients share)

### What We'll NEVER Do
- Share client content without permission
- Use identifiable information
- Sell data to third parties
- Train models on proprietary content without consent

## White Glove vs. Self-Service (Future State)

| Aspect | Self-Service | White Glove |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| Price | $99-299/mo | $3,000+ per project |
| Turnaround | Hours | 10-14 days |
| Human review | None (AI only) | Full human QA |
| Revisions | User self-edits | 2-3 rounds included |
| Support | Documentation + chat | Dedicated contact |
| Best for | Simple SOPs, tech-savvy users | Complex programs, hands-off buyers |
| Custom branding | Templates only | Fully custom |

Both feed each other:
- Self-service users who outgrow it become white glove clients
- White glove projects generate patterns that improve self-service

---

## Milestones to Track

### Phase 1: Validation (Now - Month 3)
- [ ] First paying customer
- [ ] First testimonial
- [ ] 5 completed modules
- [ ] Identify first vertical pattern

### Phase 2: Systemization (Month 3-6)
- [ ] 20 completed modules
- [ ] Claude prompts refined from real projects
- [ ] First free giveaway module live
- [ ] Repeat customer

### Phase 3: Scale Decision (Month 6-12)
- [ ] 50+ completed modules
- [ ] Clear vertical winner identified
- [ ] Decision: Specialize or stay general?
- [ ] Decision: Build self-service tool or keep concierge?

### Phase 4: Expansion (Year 2)
- [ ] Launch SOPtoSCORM.com (if validated)
- [ ] Or: Deep vertical specialization
- [ ] Or: Team expansion for white glove scale
