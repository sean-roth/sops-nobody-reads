## Cold Email Templates

### Template 1: The Direct Approach

**Subject:** Turn your employee handbook into real training?

---

Hi [Name],

I help companies turn their SOPs and employee handbooks into professional online training modules.

Most businesses have documents employees should know but don't read. I fix that.

**What you get:**
- Interactive training module (not a PDF)
- Quizzes to verify understanding
- SCORM package for any LMS
- Done in 2 weeks

**Investment:** Starting at $1,500 for a 30-minute module.

Would it make sense to chat about what you're working with?

Best,
Sean

### Template 2: The Pain Point Hook

**Subject:** Quick question about [Company] training

---

Hi [Name],

I'll keep this short.

Do you have employee documents that should be training but aren't? Handbooks collecting dust, SOPs nobody references, compliance policies people "read" by scrolling to the signature line?

I turn those into actual training—interactive modules employees complete, remember, and you can prove they finished.

Typically $1,500-3,000 per module. 2 weeks. No software to learn.

Worth a conversation?

### Template 3: The Compliance Angle

**Subject:** Quick compliance training question

---

Hi [Name],

When auditors ask "can you prove your employees completed training?"—what do you show them?

If it's signed PDFs and hope, there might be a better way.

I create professional training modules from your existing compliance documents. SCORM-packaged, quiz-verified, completion-tracked. Real proof your team knows the material.

Typically done in 2 weeks for $1,500-3,000 per module.

Happy to share an example if useful.

Best,
Sean

### Template 4: The New Hire Angle

**Subject:** New hire onboarding idea

---

Hi [Name],

How long does it take a new hire to get up to speed at [Company]?

Most of my clients had the same problem: great documentation existed, but new employees either didn't read it or forgot it immediately.

I turn those docs into actual training—interactive, quiz-verified, trackable. New hires complete it before day one. Managers stop answering the same questions.

2 weeks, $1,500-3,000 depending on scope.

Worth exploring?

Quick question: does [Company] have employee documents that should be training but aren't? Handbooks, SOPs, compliance policies people skim and forget?

Hi [Name],

Just floating this back up in case it got buried.

No pressure—just wanted to make sure you saw my note about turning your SOPs/handbooks into professional training modules.

If timing's not right, no worries. Happy to be a resource down the road.

## Referral Request Email (After Successful Project)

**Subject:** Quick favor?

---

Hi [Name],

I'm so glad the [project name] training turned out well!

Quick ask: do you know anyone else who might benefit from this service? Other business owners, HR folks, or ops managers dealing with the same "documents nobody reads" problem?

If you're comfortable making an intro, I'd really appreciate it. (And there's a 10% discount on your next project as a thank you.)

No pressure either way—just thought I'd ask.

Thanks again,
Sean

## Chamber of Commerce Outreach

**Subject:** Local business offering for [Chamber Name] members

---

Hi [Name],

I'm a Colorado-based business owner reaching out to connect with [Chamber Name].

I help local SMBs turn their employee handbooks and SOPs into professional online training. Most businesses have great documentation—but employees don't read it. I fix that.

Would you be open to:
- Listing my service in your member directory
- Sharing with members who mention training/HR needs
- A brief intro call to explain what I do

Happy to offer [Chamber] members a discount as well.

Thanks for considering,
