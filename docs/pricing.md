## Pricing Logic

### Why $1,500 for a 30-minute module?

**Traditional comparison:**
- Custom eLearning agencies charge $6,740-$33,360 per finished hour
- 30 minutes = $3,370-$16,680 at agency rates
- Our $1,500 = 55-91% savings vs traditional

**DIY tool comparison:**
- Self-service tools: $99-499 per course
- But they require: learning the tool, doing the work, iterating yourself
- We're charging for speed, expertise, and "done for you"

**Time investment:**
- Estimated 4-6 hours work per 30-min module
- $1,500 ÷ 5 hours = $300/hour effective rate
- Sustainable and profitable

## Discounting Guidelines

### When to Discount

| Situation | Discount | Rationale |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| First-time customer | 10-15% | Lower barrier, get testimonial |
| 3+ modules at once | 15-20% | Volume efficiency |
| Referral from past client | 10% | Reward referrers |
| Non-profit/education | 15-25% | Goodwill, case study potential |
| Pilot project (to win larger contract) | 20-25% | Strategic investment |

### When NOT to Discount

- Rush jobs (charge MORE, not less)
- Price shoppers comparing to DIY tools (wrong customer)
- Scope creep disguised as "just one more thing"
- Customer who doesn't value the work

### Discount Framing

**Never say:** "I'll give you a discount"

**Instead say:**
- "For your first project, I can offer pilot pricing of $X"
- "Since you're bundling three modules, I can do $X total"
- "As a thank you for [referrer]'s referral, I can offer $X"

Make it a special circumstance, not your normal price.

## Objection Handling

**"That's expensive for training"**
> "Traditional training companies charge $15-25K for this scope. And DIY tools assume you have time to learn them and build it yourself. We're the middle ground - professional quality, fast delivery, without the enterprise price."

**"I can use AI to do this myself"**
> "Absolutely! And if you have time to learn SCORM packaging, write the prompts, iterate on quality, and test in your LMS - go for it. Most of my clients tried that, realized it was a 20-hour project, and decided their time was worth more."

**"Can you do it for less?"**
> "What's your budget? Let's see if we can adjust scope to fit. Maybe we start with one module as a pilot."

**"I need to think about it"**
> "Of course. What questions can I answer to help your decision? And just so you know, this quote is valid for 30 days."
