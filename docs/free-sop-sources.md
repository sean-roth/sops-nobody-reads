## 🧪 Quality Testing Your Modules

After building a module, test it with Claude:

```
I just completed a training module on [topic]. I'm going to share the content with you.

After reviewing it, please:
1. Identify any concepts that aren't explained clearly
2. Point out jargon that isn't defined
3. Find any logical gaps in the flow
4. Take the quiz and explain your reasoning for each answer
5. Tell me what questions a learner might still have after completing this

Here's the module content:
[paste content]
```

This catches issues before clients do.
