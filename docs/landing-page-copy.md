## Section 1: The Problem (They'll Nod At This)

### Header
**Sound familiar?**

- You've got a 47-page employee handbook nobody's opened since 2019
- New hires "complete" onboarding by skimming PDFs and signing forms
- The same questions get asked every week because nobody reads the process docs
- Your compliance training is a checkbox exercise, not actual learning
- You got a quote from a training company: $20,000 and 8 weeks. You closed the tab.

**The documents exist. The training doesn't.**

## Section 2: The Solution

### Header
**Documents in. Training out. That simple.**

You send us your SOPs, handbooks, or process docs. We transform them into interactive training modules with:

✓ Clear, engaging content (not walls of text)  
✓ Knowledge checks and quizzes  
✓ SCORM packages that work with any LMS  
✓ Completion tracking for compliance  
✓ Professional design that represents your brand  

**No software to learn. No team to hire. No 8-week timelines.**
