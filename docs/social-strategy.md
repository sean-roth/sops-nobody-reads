# Social Media Strategy

## Platform Priority

1. **LinkedIn** (Primary) - Where HR/ops decision makers live
2. **YouTube** (Secondary) - Build authority with how-to content
3. **Instagram** (Tertiary) - Visual tips, behind the scenes, humanize brand

TikTok: Skip for now. Audience skews younger than target buyer.

### Company Page: SOPsNobodyReads

**Tagline:** "Turn documents nobody reads into training everyone completes."
