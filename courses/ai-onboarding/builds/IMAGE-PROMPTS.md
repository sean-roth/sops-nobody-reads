## Notes

- All prompts use Seedream 4.5 at 16:9 aspect ratio
- Theater imagery (reds, golds, velvet, stage lighting) dominates Module 2 and should feel visually distinct from Module 1's office/tech palette
- Module 2 returns to office settings for the middle "What Goes Wrong" section, then returns to theater for the resolution
- When generating: if a prompt produces too much photorealism, add "stylized, illustration, not photographic" to reinforce the art style
- The director figure (s15, s16) should be shown from behind like Joe — no face to camera
