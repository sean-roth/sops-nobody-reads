## Core Concepts to Develop

### The Alien Intelligence Frame

**Key insight:** People anthropomorphize AI immediately because it speaks fluent English. This leads to incorrect mental models and frustrated expectations.

**The frame:** AI is alien intelligence. It's fluent in your language but fundamentally diverges from human intelligence.

**What this means practically:**
- It doesn't "understand" the way you understand
- It doesn't "want" anything
- It doesn't "remember" you (unless memory features are explicitly enabled)
- It's not "trying" to help or hurt you
- Its confidence has no correlation with accuracy

**Analogies to develop:**
- Like a very sophisticated autocomplete that's read everything
- Like a savant who can mimic any style but has no original opinions
- Like a mirror that reflects patterns back at you

**What it's NOT:**
- A search engine (doesn't retrieve stored facts)
- A database (doesn't have perfect memory)
- A sentient being (no inner experience)
- A truth-teller (no commitment to accuracy)
- A friend (no relationship, no continuity)

### The Prerequisites Nobody Teaches

**Observed pattern:** People who struggle with AI often lack prerequisite skills:

1. **Clear thinking** - Can't prompt clearly if you can't think clearly
2. **Written communication** - AI interaction is fundamentally written; poor writers get poor results
3. **Self-knowledge** - Don't know their own voice, standards, or intentions
4. **Quality recognition** - Can't evaluate output because they don't know what good looks like
5. **Iteration mindset** - Expect single-shot success, give up at first failure

**The uncomfortable truth:** The best AI training might need to be writing and thinking training first.

**Course approach:** Be upfront about this. Don't pretend prompting tricks will fix fundamental communication issues.

### Observed Failure Patterns

**From Claude's perspective—what goes wrong:**

1. **The one-shot mindset**
   - User types query, gets response, accepts or gives up
   - No iteration, no "that's close but not quite"
   - Using a dialogue tool like a search engine

2. **Context starvation**
   - "Write me an email" with no who/what/why
   - Assumes AI knows their situation, audience, voice
   - Disappointed by generic output they caused

3. **Quality blindness**
   - Can't tell good writing from mediocre writing
   - Accept confident-sounding garbage
   - Lack internal standard to reject poor output

4. **No model of the technology**
   - Oscillate between "it's magic/sentient" and "it's just autocomplete"
   - Neither mental model helps use it effectively

5. **Learned helplessness**
   - Years of "I'm sorry, I didn't understand that" from Siri
   - Expect failure, give up fast
   - Don't realize modern AI is categorically different

## Bob Scenarios to Develop

### Bob's Character

- Mid-career professional, probably accounting or operations
- Not tech-averse, just hasn't updated mental models
- Well-meaning but impatient
- Makes relatable mistakes (audience should recognize themselves)
- Never malicious, just uninformed
- Growth arc: starts clueless, improves through the course

### Scenario Bank

**Module 1: What Is This Thing?**
- Bob asks "Do you remember what we talked about yesterday?"
- Gets confused response, concludes AI has amnesia
- Doesn't understand there's no persistent memory by default

**Module 2: Ghost in the Machine**
- Bob asks the same question twice, gets different answers
- Accuses AI of being inconsistent or lying
- Doesn't understand probabilistic output

**Module 3: The Problem Isn't the AI**
- Bob: "Write me an email"
- Gets generic email, sighs
- Bob: "Write me a GOOD email"
- Gets slightly less generic email, declares AI useless

**Module 4: Writing Is Thinking**
- Bob: "Make it more professional"
- AI makes changes Bob doesn't like
- Bob: "No, not like that. More professional."
- Cycle continues because "professional" means nothing specific

**Module 5: Know Thyself**
- Bob accepts an AI email that sounds "smart"
- Sends it to client
- Client confused because tone doesn't match their relationship
- Bob never defined his voice, so AI couldn't match it

**Module 6: One-Shot Catastrophe**
- Side-by-side: Bob's one attempt vs. someone iterating
- Same starting prompt, wildly different final results
- Bob gave up after step 1; the other person took 5 steps

**Module 7: Context Starvation**
- Bob: "Write a presentation for the meeting"
- AI: Produces generic corporate presentation
- Bob: "That's not what I needed at all!"
- Narrator: "But how was the AI supposed to know?"
- Reveals everything Bob assumed AI would know

**Module 8: Credulity Trap**
- Bob includes AI statistics in board presentation
- CFO: "Where did you get these numbers?"
- Bob: "The AI"
- Numbers are completely fabricated
- Bob's credibility destroyed

**Module 9: Copy-Paste Career Killer**
- Bob sends AI email to client without reading carefully
- Email promises delivery date Bob can't meet
- Email uses first name with someone Bob has never met
- Client annoyed, boss annoyed, Bob confused

**Module 10: Blame Game**
- Bob has folder called "AI Fails" on his desktop
- Shows colleagues screenshots as proof AI doesn't work
- Every screenshot shows a vague one-shot prompt
- Bob has never considered he might be the problem

## Exercise Bank

### Part Two Exercises

**Before/After Comparison (Module 3)**
- Learner states what they want in their own words
- Guided questions help them clarify:
  - Who is this for?
  - What do they already know?
  - What should happen after they read this?
  - What format makes sense?
  - What tone fits?
- Learner rewrites their request with this clarity
- Compare AI output from both versions

**Ambiguity Audit (Module 4)**
- Provide sample prompts full of ambiguous terms
- Learner highlights every word that could mean multiple things
- Discuss: "professional," "improve," "better," "fix," "more," "good"
- Learner applies same audit to their own past prompts

**Quality Definition Worksheet (Module 5)**
- What makes writing good in YOUR context?
- Tone: Formal/casual/somewhere specific?
- Length: What's appropriate for your audience?
- Evidence: Do you cite sources? Use data? Tell stories?
- Voice: How do YOU sound when you're at your best?
- Build a reference document for yourself

### Part Three Exercises

**The Reframe (Module 10)**
- Take a "failed" AI interaction
- Don't blame AI—diagnose the human input
- What was vague?
- What context was missing?
- What follow-up didn't happen?
- Redo the interaction properly

### Part Six Exercises

**AI Opportunity Audit (Module 17)**
- List 20 tasks you do repeatedly
- Rate: Time spent (1-5), Enjoyment (1-5), Judgment required (1-5)
- High time + low enjoyment + low judgment = AI opportunity
- Pick top 3 to systematize

**Personal Workflow Document (Module 18)**
- Learner documents their planned AI workflow:
  - What tasks will I use AI for?
  - What context will I provide by default?
  - How will I review output?
  - What are my red lines?
- Living document they update over time

### Comparison Points
- What Anthropic teaches vs. what we teach
- Our course as prerequisite to their technical courses
- Complementary positioning, not competitive

### Academic/Research
- Studies on AI adoption barriers (to find)
- Writing-thinking connection research (to find)
- Human-AI collaboration patterns (to find)

## Quotes and Soundbites to Develop

*For narrator voiceover:*

- "If you don't know what you want, the AI certainly doesn't."
- "Clear thinking precedes clear prompting."
- "You can't outsource judgment to a machine that has none."
- "The AI is fluent in your language. It is not fluent in your intentions."
- "Your frustration is feedback. What is it telling you?"
- "The first draft is raw material, not a deliverable."
- "It's a conversation, not a command."
- "You're the expert. It's the intern."

## Gaps to Fill

- [ ] More specific examples for each industry/role
- [ ] Case studies from real implementations
- [ ] Technical accuracy review on LLM explanations
- [ ] Legal/compliance considerations by region
- [ ] Accessibility considerations for delivery
