# Market Positioning

How "So You Want to Work with AI!" fits into the existing training landscape.

---

## The Driver's Ed Angle

This course is **driver's ed for AI.** Not the car — the skill of driving.

We don't teach a specific tool (though it's best with Claude). We teach the rules of the road, basic maintenance, and hand them a travel brochure for road trips.

### Why This Analogy Works

- **Nobody thinks driver's ed expires.** The rules of the road don't change when a new car model comes out. Clear thinking and communication don't change when Claude gets an update.
- **It's obviously a prerequisite.** You wouldn't hand someone keys without it. You shouldn't hand someone an AI subscription without it.
- **It's tool-agnostic but not tool-ignorant.** Driving schools use a specific car. We teach with Claude. But the skills transfer to anything.
- **It justifies the price differently.** Nobody haggles over driver's ed. It's foundational. You either have it or you don't.
- **It's evergreen.** The content doesn't become obsolete when the next model drops. Foundational skills are permanent.

### The Three Stages as Driver's Ed

| Stage | Driver's Ed Equivalent | What They Learn |
|-------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Stage 1: Work With the Machine | Rules of the road + basic driving | What AI is, how to communicate with it, how to evaluate output |
| Stage 2: Customize the Machine | Maintenance, customizing your vehicle, knowing your route | Claude Projects, custom instructions, MCP, workflows |
| Stage 3: Build With the Machine | Road trips — long-haul navigation, building your own rig | Agents, Claude Code, multi-agent orchestration |

### Messaging Implications

- **For the reluctant buyer:** "You wouldn't let someone drive without training. Why are you letting them use AI without it?"
- **For the 'we already did AI training' objection:** "Did you teach them prompt tricks, or did you teach them how to drive? There's a difference."
- **For the evergreen concern:** "AI tools change every month. The skills we teach don't. That's why this isn't an expense — it's an investment your team keeps forever."

## The Gap We Fill

### What Exists (Anthropic & Others)

**Anthropic Academy:**
- AI Fluency: Framework & Foundations
- Build with Claude (developer track)
- MCP courses
- Claude Code courses

**Other providers:**
- Coursera/edX: General AI courses, often academic
- LinkedIn Learning: Tool tutorials, surface-level
- Corporate training vendors: Generic, often outdated
- YouTube/free content: Scattered, quality varies wildly

### What They Teach

✅ What buttons to click
✅ How to format prompts
✅ API usage and technical implementation
✅ Safety and ethics frameworks
✅ Feature walkthroughs

### What They Assume

❌ You can think clearly about what you need
❌ You can communicate precisely in writing
❌ You know your own voice, standards, and intentions
❌ You can recognize quality output when you see it
❌ You understand that iteration is normal, not failure

### The Result

People complete courses but still can't get useful output because the courses taught the HOW without addressing the underlying WHY of failure.

---

## Our Position

**We are:** The prerequisite course that Anthropic's courses assume you don't need.

**We address:** The human factors that determine AI success—clear thinking, written communication, self-knowledge, quality recognition, iteration mindset.

**We assume:** Nothing about your AI experience. We start with what AI actually IS before teaching you to use it.

**We deliver:** Practical improvement for people who've tried AI and found it frustrating, AND a solid foundation for people just starting.

---

## Positioning Statement

**For** business professionals who need to use AI effectively,

**Who** have tried AI tools and found them disappointing, or who are just getting started and want to avoid common mistakes,

**"So You Want to Work with AI!"** is a comprehensive training course

**That** teaches the thinking skills, communication clarity, and mental models that make AI tools actually useful,

**Unlike** technical tutorials that assume you already know what you want and just need to learn the buttons,

**We** start with why people fail—unclear thinking, poor communication, wrong expectations—and build the foundation that makes all other AI training work.

## Competitive Landscape

| Provider | Strength | Gap |
|----------|----------|-----|
| Anthropic Academy | Official, authoritative, free | Assumes prerequisites |
| Coursera | Academic credibility | Often theoretical, slow to update |
| LinkedIn Learning | Accessible, broad catalog | Surface-level, tool-focused |
| YouTube | Free, abundant | Quality inconsistent, scattered |
| Corporate vendors | Enterprise relationships | Generic, often outdated |
| **Us** | **Human factors focus** | New entrant, no brand recognition yet |

## Messaging Framework

### Headlines

**Problem-focused:**
- "Why AI Isn't Working for You (It's Not the AI)"
- "The AI Training That Starts with You, Not the Tools"
- "Before You Learn Another Prompt Trick, Learn This"

**Solution-focused:**
- "Finally Understand How to Actually Use AI"
- "The Foundation Every AI Course Skips"
- "Work with AI Like Someone Who Gets It"

**Outcome-focused:**
- "Stop Fighting AI. Start Collaborating."
- "From 'AI is Useless' to 'AI is Essential'"
- "Get Results from AI in Hours, Not Months of Frustration"

### Key Messages

1. **The problem is usually the human, not the AI.** Not as insult—as diagnosis. Most AI "failures" are actually communication failures.

2. **Clear thinking precedes clear prompting.** No prompt template fixes unclear intentions.

3. **AI is alien intelligence.** Fluent in your language, fundamentally unlike you. This changes how you work with it.

4. **Iteration is the point, not the problem.** If you expect one-shot perfection, you'll always be disappointed.

5. **You can't outsource judgment.** AI amplifies your judgment; it doesn't replace it.

## Objection Handling

**"We already did AI training."**
→ "Did it work? Are your people actually using AI effectively? Our course addresses why most AI training fails to change behavior."

**"Can't my team just watch YouTube tutorials?"**
→ "They can learn what buttons to click. They won't learn why they're still frustrated afterward. We address the thinking skills that make tutorials actually useful."

**"AI is changing too fast—won't this be outdated?"**
→ "Tool features change. Clear thinking, quality recognition, and communication skills don't. This is driver's ed, not a car manual. The rules of the road don't change when a new model comes out."

**"This seems expensive for training."**
→ "What's the cost of your team wasting 30 minutes a day on ineffective AI use? Or worse, embarrassing errors from unreviewed output?"

**"Why not just use Anthropic's free courses?"**
→ "Great courses! They teach the tools. We teach why your people aren't getting value from the tools. Start with us, then their courses will actually land."
