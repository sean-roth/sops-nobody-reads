# Module 5: Build Your Playbook

**Duration:** 25-30 minutes  
**Part:** Two - Work With the Machine

---

## COLD OPEN

*[SCENE: Two versions of the same Monday morning. Same person — call her Dana, early 40s, director of client services at a mid-size firm. Two parallel timelines.]*

**Timeline A:**

*[Dana opens AI. Stares at the blank input. Types:]*

**DANA (A):** *(typing)* Help me write a response to a client who's upset about a missed deadline.

*[The response comes back. Polished. Professional. Completely wrong tone for this client, this relationship, this situation. Dana sighs, starts over. Adds more detail. Gets something closer. Still not right. Adds more. Iterates. Ten minutes in, she's rewriting most of it herself anyway.]*

**Timeline B:**

*[Dana opens AI. But this time, before she types anything, she drops in a document. A single page. Then she types:]*

**DANA (B):** *(typing)* Northbridge is upset about the Phase 2 delay. They're our longest-standing client — you have the context. I need a response that acknowledges the miss, explains the vendor issue without making excuses, and gives them a revised timeline. Sarah Chen is the contact — she's direct and doesn't like fluff.

*[The response comes back. It gets the tone right. It references the relationship correctly. It handles the vendor issue with the right level of candor. Dana reads it, changes one line, hits send. Three minutes.]*

*[Beat.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Same person. Same task. Same AI.

The difference is one page.

## WHAT CHANGED

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
The document Dana loaded is what we call a Working Context Document. Think of it as a playbook — a single reference that tells the machine who you are, how you work, what you care about, and what "good" looks like in your world.

*[Beat.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Without it, every conversation with AI starts from zero. You have to re-explain your role, your tone, your standards, your audience — every single time. It's like briefing a new temp worker every morning who has no memory of yesterday.

With it, the machine already knows the basics. Your first message can skip the preamble and get straight to the work. The context document does the heavy lifting so your prompts can be short, specific, and focused on the task at hand.

*[Beat.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
This is the most valuable thing you'll build in this course. Not because it's complicated — it isn't. But because it turns everything you've learned so far into a permanent tool. The Sixty-Second Check, the four elements, the conversation skills from Module 4 — all of that becomes embedded in a document you write once and use every day.

---

## WHAT GOES IN IT

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
A Working Context Document has five sections. That's it. No special format, no template to buy. Just five things the machine needs to know about you to do consistently good work.

*[VISUAL: Five sections building one at a time. Clean. Simple.]*

**Section one: Who you are.**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Your role. Your responsibilities. What you actually do day to day — not your job title, but the real work. "I'm the Director of Client Services at a 200-person consulting firm. I manage relationships with our top 15 accounts and oversee a team of 6 account managers." This tells the machine your vantage point. Everything it produces will be calibrated to someone at your level, with your scope.

**Section two: Who you talk to.**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Your key audiences. Not a list of every person you email — the categories of people you communicate with regularly and what matters to each of them. "My clients are senior executives who want concise updates, not details. My team needs clear direction with enough context to act independently. My CEO wants bottom-line impact, not process." The machine can't adjust tone for your audience if it doesn't know who your audiences are.

**Section three: How you sound.**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Your voice. Your communication style. And be specific — not "professional" but the real thing. "I'm direct but not blunt. I acknowledge problems before jumping to solutions. I don't use buzzwords. I write short sentences. When I give feedback, I lead with what's working before I address what isn't."

This is the section most people skip, and it's the one that makes the biggest difference. Without it, the machine writes in its default voice — which sounds like nobody in particular. With it, the output starts to sound like you.

*[Beat.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Here's a trick for writing this section. Go back through your last twenty emails — the ones you wrote yourself, not the ones you agonized over. The ones you fired off in two minutes because you knew exactly what to say. Look at the patterns. How do you open? How do you close? How long are your paragraphs? Do you use contractions? Do you ask questions or make statements? That's your voice. Write it down.

**Section four: What good looks like.**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Your standards. Your definition of done. What makes you hit send immediately versus what makes you rewrite the whole thing. "A good client email from me is under 150 words, addresses the issue in the first sentence, and ends with a clear next step. A good internal update leads with the decision, then supporting context, never the other way around."

This section is your quality filter. It gives the machine a finish line so it's not guessing what you'll accept.

**Section five: What to avoid.**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Your boundaries. The things that make you cringe. The patterns you never want to see. "Never open with 'I hope this email finds you well.' Don't use the word 'synergy.' Don't hedge with phrases like 'I just wanted to check in' — if I'm checking in, say so directly. Don't bullet-point everything — I write in prose."

Remember — telling the machine what NOT to do is one of the most powerful instructions you can give. This section eliminates the most common failures before they happen.

## LET'S BUILD ONE

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Enough theory. Let's build one. Right now. Live. And we're going to do it the way Module 4 taught you — as a conversation.

*[SCENE: Joe's desk. He's back one more time. He's got a blank document open and his AI ready.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Joe's going to build his Working Context Document with the machine's help. Not by filling in a template — by having a conversation about his work and letting the structure emerge.

*[Joe types.]*

**JOE:** *(typing)* I want to create a reference document about how I work so I can use it in future conversations with you. Let me start by telling you about my role. I'm a regional sales rep for an industrial supply company. I cover the Mountain West — Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, Montana. I manage about 40 active accounts, mostly plant managers and procurement directors at manufacturing facilities. My job is maintaining relationships, upselling existing accounts, and bringing in new business. I've been doing this for six years.

*[The AI responds — it organizes what Joe said, asks a few clarifying questions: What's the mix of relationship maintenance vs. new business? What industries are most of your accounts in? Are there common objections you deal with?]*

*[Joe answers.]*

**JOE:** *(typing)* It's about 70/30 — mostly keeping existing accounts happy and growing, with some prospecting. Most of my accounts are in food manufacturing, mining, and general industrial. The common objection is always price — we're not the cheapest, but our delivery reliability and technical support are better than anyone in the region. I usually win on service, not price.

*[The AI refines the description, then prompts Joe to talk about his communication style.]*

**JOE:** *(typing)* I'm pretty casual. My clients aren't corporate — they're plant managers and procurement guys who've been doing this for 20 years. They respect you if you know your products and don't waste their time. I keep emails short. I don't do formal proposals unless someone specifically asks. Most of my deals close over the phone or in person after I've already sent a quote. My follow-ups are friendly but persistent — I don't let things go quiet.

*[Beat.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Watch what's happening. Joe isn't filling out a form. He's describing his work — the same way he'd explain it to a new colleague on their first day. And the machine is helping him organize it into something structured and reusable.

*[The AI produces a draft Working Context Document. Clean. Organized into the five sections. It captures Joe's role, his accounts, his voice ("casual, direct, knows the products"), his standards ("short emails, no formal proposals unless asked"), and his avoids ("no corporate language, no time-wasting pleasantries").]*

*[Joe reads it. Adds one thing — his key account Dave Kowalski at Pacific Ridge Supply, because that relationship has specific dynamics the machine should know about. He also adds: "When I'm writing to a new contact, I mention a specific product or industry challenge so they know I've done my homework."]*

*[Beat.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Ten minutes. Joe now has a document that makes every future AI conversation about his work start from a foundation of context. Instead of re-explaining his role, his tone, and his audience every time, he drops this in and goes straight to the task.

*[VISUAL: Side by side. Left: Joe's first-ever prompt from Module 2 — "Write a professional email to a client about a price increase." Right: Joe's new workflow — drops in context document, types "Pacific Ridge is getting a 7% increase in March, need to tell Dave. He'll push back on price — lead with the delivery improvements we made last quarter." The output on the right is specific, informed, and sounds like Joe.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
That's the arc of this entire course. From a vague instruction that produced generic output — to a targeted, context-rich conversation that produces work Joe would actually send.

## IT'S A LIVING DOCUMENT

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
One thing to understand: your Working Context Document is not a one-time exercise. It's alive. It changes as your work changes.

*[Beat.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
New client with unusual requirements? Add a note. Realized you keep correcting the same tone issue? Update your voice section. Got promoted and your audience shifted from peers to executives? Rewrite who you talk to.

The document grows with you. Most people update theirs once or twice a month — not on a schedule, just when they notice a gap. Something comes back wrong, and they realize: I never told the machine about this. So they add it. Over time, the document gets sharper and the output gets closer to right on the first try.

*[Beat.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Think of it like training a new team member. The first week, you explain everything. The second week, you explain less. By the third month, they know your preferences and you just say "handle it." Your context document is that training — except it happens in a page instead of a quarter.

---

## THE COMPOUND EFFECT

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Let's talk about what this actually saves you.

*[VISUAL: Simple math on screen.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Without a context document, every AI interaction starts with setup. You spend two, three, four minutes explaining who you are, what you need, and how you want it. Even if you're fast. Even if you know the four elements cold. Because the machine doesn't remember.

With a context document, you skip that setup. Your first message is the task — nothing else. And the output is better on the first try because the machine already has your context, your voice, and your standards.

Let's say that saves you five minutes per interaction. If you use AI ten times a day — and once you're comfortable, you will — that's fifty minutes. Every day. That's over four hours a week of setup time you'll never spend again.

But the real savings isn't time. It's quality. Because every interaction starts from a higher baseline, you spend less time iterating. Less time correcting tone. Less time adding context you forgot to include. The compound effect of consistently better starting points is the difference between AI being a novelty and AI being essential to how you work.

## YOUR TURN

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Here's your exercise — and this is the most important one in the course.

*[VISUAL: Instructions on screen.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Build your Working Context Document. Right now. Open a conversation with AI and tell it what you just watched Joe do. Then talk about your work.

Start with who you are and what you actually do. Not your title — your real work. Then talk about who you communicate with and what matters to each audience. Describe how you write — look at your sent emails if you need to. Define what good looks like. And list what you never want to see.

Don't try to make it perfect. Your first version will be incomplete. That's fine. Use it for a day. See what's missing. Add it. Use it again. Refine it.

*[Beat.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Within a week, you'll have a document that makes AI feel like it knows you. Not because it does — because you told it who you are.

And that's the whole point of this course. Not "how to prompt." Not "AI tips and tricks." How to take what you know — the tacit knowledge that makes you good at your job — and make it explicit in a way that any capable system can use to help you work faster, better, and more like yourself.

*[Beat.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Your Working Context Document is the proof that you've made that shift. Keep it. Update it. Use it every day. It's the most valuable page you'll write this year.

## END CARD

*[VISUAL: Module 5 summary card.]*

**Key Concepts:**

- A Working Context Document is a reusable reference that gives AI your role, voice, audiences, standards, and boundaries
- Five sections: Who You Are, Who You Talk To, How You Sound, What Good Looks Like, What to Avoid
- Build it as a conversation with AI, not by filling in a template
- It eliminates repetitive setup from every future interaction
- It's a living document — update it as your work changes
- The compound effect: better starting points → less iteration → consistently higher quality output
- Your voice section is the most impactful — go read your own sent emails to find it
- This is the capstone of the course: your tacit knowledge, made explicit, made permanent

## NOTES FOR PRODUCTION

**Cold open — two timelines:**
- This is the "before and after" that sells the entire module. The contrast between Dana A (struggling through setup) and Dana B (dropping in context and going straight to work) should feel dramatic but achievable. The audience should think: "I want to be Timeline B."
- Dana B's prompt is short — that's the point. The context document did the work. Her prompt is just the task. Show how brief it is compared to Dana A's frustrated re-explaining.

**Five sections:**
- Present these conversationally, not as a rigid framework. The framing should be "five things the machine needs to know" not "five sections to fill out." Keep it feeling like advice, not homework.
- The voice section needs emphasis. "Go read your last twenty emails" is practical, specific, and something they can do immediately. Don't rush past it.
- "What to avoid" should feel empowering, not negative. This is where personality shows up. "Never open with 'I hope this email finds you well'" should get a knowing nod from the audience.

**Joe builds his document:**
- Joe's third and final appearance in the course. His arc is complete: Module 2 he failed with a one-liner, Module 4 he learned to have a conversation, Module 5 he builds the tool that makes the conversation permanent.
- The conversation format matters. Joe doesn't fill in a template — he talks about his work and the AI helps organize it. This models the exact process the audience should follow.
- Joe adding Dave Kowalski and the "new contact homework" detail is important — it shows that the most valuable parts of a context document are the specific, personal details that only you know. The machine helped with structure. Joe provided the substance.
- The side-by-side comparison at the end (Module 2 prompt vs. Module 5 workflow) is the payoff for the entire course. Let it breathe.

**Living document section:**
- Keep this short. The point is simple: it changes when you change. Don't belabor it.
- The "training a new team member" metaphor is strong. First week = explain everything. Third month = "handle it."

**Compound effect:**
- The math (5 min × 10 interactions × 5 days = 4+ hours/week) should be on screen. Let them see it. But follow immediately with "the real savings isn't time, it's quality." Time savings get attention. Quality improvement creates lasting behavior change.

**Practice exercise:**
- This is the capstone. The single most important thing they do in the entire course. Frame it as such — not "here's an exercise" but "this is why you took this course."
- "Don't try to make it perfect. Your first version will be incomplete. That's fine." — This line prevents paralysis. The audience will want to get it right. Give them permission to start rough.

**Joe's complete arc:**
- Module 2: "Write a professional email to a client about a price increase." (Failure)
- Module 4: Conversation with context, feedback, iteration. (Skill building)
- Module 5: Context document → short task prompt → output he'd actually send. (Mastery)
- This arc should feel satisfying. The audience has watched Joe grow. They should see themselves in his journey.

**Pacing:**
- Cold open (Dana's two timelines): ~3 min
- What changed / what it is: ~2 min
- Five sections: ~5 min
- Joe builds his document: ~7 min
- Living document: ~2 min
- Compound effect: ~3 min
- Practice exercise: ~3 min
- Target total: ~25 min (allow ±2 min)

**Tone:**
- This module should feel like arrival. The audience has been building toward this. Part One diagnosed the problem. Module 4 taught the skill. Module 5 is the payoff — the thing they walk away with.
- Confident, not breathless. The energy is "you're ready for this" not "one more thing to learn."
- The closing lines ("the most valuable page you'll write this year") should feel earned, not hyperbolic. By this point, the audience has seen the evidence.
