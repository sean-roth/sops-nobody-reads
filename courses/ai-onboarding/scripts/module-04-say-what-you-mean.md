# Module 4: Say What You Mean

**Duration:** 25-30 minutes  
**Part:** Two - Work With the Machine

---

## PART TWO OPENING

*[VISUAL: Part Two title card. Clean. Forward-looking. A shift in energy from diagnosis to action.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Welcome to Part Two.

In Part One, we asked you to understand three things: what AI actually is, what it isn't, and why the gap between what you know and what you type is where most failures happen.

That was the diagnosis.

This is the prescription.

*[Beat.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Part Two is where you learn to work. Not *about* AI—*with* it. Starting right now, with the most fundamental skill there is.

Saying what you mean.

*[TITLE CARD: "Say What You Mean"]*

## COLD OPEN

*[SCENE: A series of quick cuts. Different people, different desks, different tasks. All typing into AI. All making the same category of mistake.]*

*[A marketing manager types: "Write me some social media posts."]*

*[A project lead types: "Summarize this document."]*

*[An HR specialist types: "Draft a policy update."]*

*[A sales rep types: "Help me with a proposal."]*

*[Each one frowns at what comes back. Different faces. Same expression.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
You've seen this before. You've probably *done* this before. And now you know why it doesn't work.

But knowing why isn't the same as knowing how. So let's build that.

## THE ANATOMY OF A GOOD PROMPT

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
A good prompt isn't long. It isn't fancy. It isn't a magic formula you memorize.

A good prompt is a complete thought.

*[Beat.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Remember the Sixty-Second Check from Module 3?

*[VISUAL: The framework reappears—familiar now, like meeting an old friend.]*

**WHO** is going to read this?  
**WHAT** do I need it to say?  
**WHY** does it need to exist—what should happen after?  
**HOW** should it sound? What's my voice here?  
**WHAT NOT**—what would make this wrong?

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
That was the thinking tool. Now let's turn it into a writing tool. Because the Sixty-Second Check doesn't just help you think—it gives you the raw material for a prompt that actually works.

*[Beat.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Let's watch it happen. Live. No tricks. No templates.

---

## REWRITE #1: THE EMAIL

*[SCENE: Joe's desk. He's back—same guy, different week. He needs to write an email to a new contact, Lisa Park, about scheduling a product demo.]*

*[VISUAL: Split screen. Left side: "THE OLD JOE." Right side: "THE NEW JOE." We'll watch both approaches side by side.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Old Joe.

*[Left side. Joe types immediately.]*

**JOE (OLD):** *(typing)* Write a professional email to schedule a demo.

*[Response appears. Generic. "Dear [Name], I hope this email finds you well. I would like to schedule a product demonstration at your earliest convenience..."]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
New Joe.

*[Right side. Joe pauses. Thinks for a moment. Then types.]*

**JOE (NEW):** *(typing)* I need to email Lisa Park, Director of Procurement at Greenfield Industries. We met briefly at the NACS trade show last week—she stopped by our booth and asked about our inventory management system. She seemed most interested in the automated reorder feature. I want to suggest a 30-minute demo next week, Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon. Keep it short and warm—she was friendly and direct in person. Don't oversell. Just confirm her interest and make it easy to say yes.

*[Response appears. It references the trade show. Mentions the automated reorder feature. Suggests specific days. Sounds like a real person following up on a real conversation. Brief. Warm. Easy to say yes to.]*

*[Beat.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Same task. One produced a form letter. The other produced a message Lisa might actually respond to.

*[VISUAL: The right-side prompt highlights in segments, each mapping to a Sixty-Second Check question.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Look at what New Joe included.

**WHO:** Lisa Park, Director of Procurement at Greenfield Industries.  
**WHAT:** Schedule a 30-minute demo, Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon.  
**WHY:** She expressed interest at NACS—specifically in automated reorder. The goal is a confirmed meeting.  
**HOW:** Short, warm, not salesy. Match the tone of their in-person interaction.  
**WHAT NOT:** Don't oversell. Don't be formal. Don't make it hard to respond.

*[Beat.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
None of this was hard to write. Joe already knew all of it. The only difference is that he took sixty seconds to say it.

---

## THE FOUR ELEMENTS

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Now let's pull back and look at what makes a prompt work structurally. Not as a formula—as a way of seeing.

*[VISUAL: Four elements appear, building one at a time. Simple. Clean. No jargon.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Every effective prompt shares four elements. Not always in the same order. Not always in the same proportion. But they're always there.

**Element one: Context.**

*[VISUAL: The word CONTEXT appears.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Who is this for? What's the situation? What has already happened? This is your tacit knowledge, made explicit. It's the stuff your brain knows automatically that the machine needs you to say out loud.

Joe telling the machine about the trade show, about Lisa's role, about the feature she liked—that's context. Without it, the machine is guessing. With it, the machine is working from the same reality you are.

**Element two: Task.**

*[VISUAL: The word TASK appears.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
What specifically do you need produced? Not "an email"—that's a format. A task is: write a follow-up email that suggests a 30-minute demo next Tuesday or Wednesday. The more precisely you define the task, the less the machine has to improvise. And machine improvisation is where generic output comes from.

**Element three: Tone.**

*[VISUAL: The word TONE appears.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
How should this sound? And remember from Module 3—"professional" is not a tone. "Short, warm, not salesy" is a tone. "Factual and solutions-oriented" is a tone. "Like I'm talking to a colleague I respect but don't know well" is a tone. The more specific you are about how something should *feel*, the closer the output matches your voice.

**Element four: Boundaries.**

*[VISUAL: The word BOUNDARIES appears.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
What should this *not* be? This is the element most people skip, and it's one of the most powerful. "Don't oversell." "Keep it under 200 words." "Don't use jargon." "Skip the preamble." Telling the machine what to avoid is often more useful than telling it what to include—because it eliminates the most common failure modes before they happen.

*[Beat.]*

*[VISUAL: All four elements visible together: CONTEXT — TASK — TONE — BOUNDARIES]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Context, Task, Tone, Boundaries. That's it. Not a template to fill in. A mental checklist to make sure you've said what you mean before you hit enter.

And notice—these aren't AI concepts. These are communication concepts. If you were delegating this email to a new hire, you'd give them the same four things. The machine is no different. It needs what any capable stranger would need to do good work on your behalf.

---

## REWRITE #2: THE SUMMARY

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Let's try a different kind of task. Not an email—a summary.

*[SCENE: New character. Priya, mid-30s, project manager. She's just come out of a 90-minute stakeholder meeting and needs to send a recap.]*

*[VISUAL: Same split-screen format. Left: the old way. Right: the new way.]*

**PRIYA (OLD):** *(typing)* Summarize the meeting notes.

*[She pastes in raw, unstructured notes—half-sentences, abbreviations, tangents. The AI produces a summary that's technically accurate but reads like a transcript was fed through a blender. Every topic gets equal weight. No prioritization. No action items pulled out. Just... a shorter version of the mess.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Technically correct. Practically useless.

*[Right side.]*

**PRIYA (NEW):** *(typing)* I need a meeting recap for the product team based on the notes I'll paste below. This was a 90-minute stakeholder review for the Q2 website redesign. The key decisions were: (1) we're keeping the March 15 launch date, (2) the hero section redesign is approved but the nav changes are pushed to Phase 2, (3) legal still needs to review the updated privacy language. Format it with a "Decisions" section, an "Open Items" section with owners and deadlines, and a "Parking Lot" for things we tabled. Keep it to one page. My director skims these—lead with what matters.

*[Pastes the same messy notes.]*

*[The summary that comes back is structured. Clear. Decisions at top. Open items with names and dates. Parking lot at the bottom. It reads like something a competent PM actually wrote.]*

*[Beat.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Same notes. Same AI. Priya's version works because she told the machine three things the old approach didn't: what the important decisions were, how to structure the output, and who was going to read it.

She didn't ask the machine to figure out what mattered. She already knew what mattered—she was *in* the meeting. She just needed the machine to organize it.

*[Beat.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
And that's a critical distinction. The machine is not your analyst. It's your hands. You do the thinking. It does the formatting, the structuring, the drafting at speed. The intelligence is yours. The labor is shared.

---

## REWRITE #3: THE CREATIVE ASK

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
One more. And this one is where people struggle the most.

*[SCENE: Marcus, late 40s, runs a small landscaping company. He needs social media content but has never written a post in his life.]*

**MARCUS (OLD):** *(typing)* Write some social media posts for my landscaping business.

*[The AI produces four posts. They're fine. They're also indistinguishable from every other landscaping company's social media. "Transform your outdoor space! 🌿 Contact us today for a free consultation!" Stock enthusiasm. Zero personality.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
This is the default. This is what "average" looks like when you ask for it. And for a small business trying to stand out, average is invisible.

*[Right side.]*

**MARCUS (NEW):** *(typing)* I run a landscaping company in Raleigh, NC—mostly residential, some commercial. Our specialty is native plant gardens that actually survive Carolina summers without constant watering. My customers are homeowners who care about their yards but don't want to spend every weekend on maintenance. I need 4 social media posts for Instagram. Tone should be knowledgeable but not preachy—like a neighbor who happens to know a lot about plants. Include one post about why centipede grass beats fescue in the Triangle, one about a recent project (we just finished a rain garden install in Cary), and two seasonal tips for February. Keep them short—under 150 words each. No emojis. No "Transform your outdoor space" energy.

*[The posts that come back reference specific plants, specific geography, specific expertise. They sound like a person who actually knows dirt, not a marketing template.]*

*[Beat.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Marcus doesn't know anything about "prompt engineering." He doesn't know what a context window is. He just told the machine who he is, who his customers are, what he actually knows, and what he doesn't want. He made his tacit knowledge—twenty years of landscaping in the Carolina clay—explicit.

And the machine turned it into content that sounds like *him.*

## THE COMMON MISTAKES

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Now. Before we move on, let's name the three most common mistakes people make even when they're *trying* to write good prompts. Because knowing the framework doesn't make you immune to shortcuts.

*[VISUAL: Three mistakes, appearing one at a time.]*

**Mistake one: The adjective trap.**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
We covered this with Joe, but it's worth repeating because it's the most persistent habit. Adding "detailed," "comprehensive," "thorough," "well-researched," or "engaging" to a prompt does almost nothing. These are wishes, not instructions. "Write a detailed report" and "write a report" will produce nearly identical output. What changes the output is *what you put in the report,* not what adjectives you attach to it.

*[Beat.]*

**Mistake two: The missing audience.**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
WHO is going to read this? Most people never say. But a project update for your director reads completely differently than the same update for your team. A proposal for a CFO leads with numbers. The same proposal for a COO leads with operations impact. If you don't specify the audience, the machine writes for no one in particular—and text written for no one in particular is useful to no one in particular.

*[Beat.]*

**Mistake three: No definition of done.**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
How will you know when this is right? What does "good" look like? If your only evaluation criterion is "I'll know it when I see it," you're going to burn time iterating in circles. Before you prompt, decide: What would make me hit send immediately? What would make me rewrite the whole thing? The clearer your finish line, the fewer laps you run.

---

## THE PRACTICE

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Theory is nothing without practice. So here's what we'd like you to do—right now, or as soon as you can after this module.

*[VISUAL: Simple instructions on screen. Clean. Actionable.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Think of a real task you need to do this week. An actual email, a real summary, a genuine piece of writing that's sitting on your to-do list. Something you'd normally just type into AI and hope for the best.

Now, before you type anything, run the Sixty-Second Check.

WHO is going to read it?  
WHAT does it need to say?  
WHY does it need to exist?  
HOW should it sound?  
WHAT NOT—what would ruin it?

Write down your answers. They don't have to be polished. They just have to be specific. Then type them into the machine—not as a separate step, but *as your prompt.* Your thinking becomes your instructions.

*[Beat.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Then look at what comes back. Not with the question "is this good?" but with specific questions: Did it get the audience right? Is the tone what I asked for? Does it include what I needed and exclude what I didn't?

If yes—you've just experienced what clear prompting produces.

If no—look at your prompt and ask: what did I leave out? What did I assume the machine would know? That gap is your next improvement.

*[Beat.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
This is the whole skill. Thinking, writing, evaluating, adjusting. It gets faster every time you do it. Within a week, the Sixty-Second Check stops being a checklist and starts being instinct.

## NOTES FOR PRODUCTION

**Part Two opening:**
- Energy shift from Part One. Part One was reflective, philosophical, building understanding. Part Two should feel like rolling up your sleeves. Same narrator voice, but the tone says: now we work.
- Keep the Part Two intro under 30 seconds. The audience already bought in—don't re-sell them.

**Cold open montage:**
- Quick cuts. Four or five people, diverse settings, all making the same mistake. Under 45 seconds total. The point isn't to dwell—it's to show this is universal, not just Joe.
- These characters don't need names or backstories. They're quick flashes of recognition.

**Split-screen rewrites:**
- This is the core teaching device of the module. Old way vs. new way, side by side, same task.
- The old prompts should feel painfully recognizable. The audience should wince.
- The new prompts should feel achievable—not genius-level, just thoughtful. The audience should think "I could write that."
- Three rewrites is the right number: email (familiar), summary (work staple), creative (unexpected). Don't add more—three makes the pattern clear without belaboring it.

**Marcus the landscaper:**
- This character matters. He's not a knowledge worker. He doesn't know AI jargon. He's a guy who knows plants and dirt and Carolina clay. His success demonstrates that this skill isn't about technical sophistication—it's about knowing your own expertise and saying it plainly.
- "No 'Transform your outdoor space' energy" should get a laugh. It's the kind of specific, opinionated boundary that immediately makes a prompt better.

**Four elements (Context, Task, Tone, Boundaries):**
- Present these as a lens, not a formula. "A way of seeing" is the right framing. If it feels like a template, the audience will try to fill it in mechanically and miss the point.
- The comparison to delegating to a new hire is important. It grounds the concept in something every professional has done. You wouldn't hand a new employee a task and say "make it good." You'd tell them what you know.

**Common mistakes:**
- Three is the right number. Quick, punchy, memorable.
- The adjective trap is a deliberate callback to Module 3. Repetition is fine here—it's the most persistent bad habit and deserves reinforcement.
- "Text written for no one in particular is useful to no one in particular" is a quotable line. Let it land.

**Practice exercise:**
- This is the first time we ask the audience to actually DO something with a real task. It should feel like a genuine invitation, not homework.
- The evaluation criteria ("Did it get the audience right? Is the tone what I asked for?") are a preview of Module 5's deeper treatment of evaluation. Plant the seed here.

**Pacing:**
- Part Two opening: ~30 sec
- Cold open montage: ~45 sec
- Rewrite #1 (email): ~5 min
- Four elements: ~4 min
- Rewrite #2 (summary): ~4 min
- Rewrite #3 (creative): ~4 min
- Common mistakes: ~3 min
- Practice exercise: ~3 min
- Target total: ~25 min (allow ±2 min)

**Tone throughout:**
- Practical. Energetic. No more philosophy—just skill-building.
- The narrator's stance shifts from "let me show you the problem" to "let me show you how this works." Same warmth, more momentum.
- Examples should feel real, not contrived. The audience should recognize their own tasks in at least one of the three rewrites.
