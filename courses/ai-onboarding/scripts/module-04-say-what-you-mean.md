# Module 4: Say What You Mean

**Duration:** 25-30 minutes  
**Part:** Two - Work With the Machine

---

## PART TWO OPENING

*[VISUAL: Part Two title card. Clean. Forward-looking. A shift in energy from diagnosis to action.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Welcome to Part Two.

In Part One, we asked you to understand three things: what AI actually is, what it isn't, and why the gap between what you know and what you type is where most failures happen.

That was the diagnosis.

This is the prescription.

*[Beat.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Part Two is where you learn to work. Not *about* AI—*with* it. Starting right now, with the most fundamental skill there is.

Saying what you mean.

*[TITLE CARD: "Say What You Mean"]*

---

## COLD OPEN

*[SCENE: Two people at desks. Side by side. Same task—writing a client proposal. One is typing rapid-fire commands into AI. Delete. Retype. Delete. Retype. Getting increasingly frustrated. The other is... talking. Typing a line. Reading the response. Typing another line. Adjusting. Moving forward. Relaxed. Productive.]*

*[The first person gives up after ten minutes with nothing usable. The second person has a finished draft in eight.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Same tool. Same task. Same amount of time.

One of them thinks they're operating a machine. The other one is having a conversation.

*[Beat.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
That's the difference this module is about. And it's simpler than you think.

---

## FORGET THE WORD "PROMPTING"

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Let's start by getting rid of a word that's causing more harm than good.

*[VISUAL: The word "PROMPTING" in large type. It crumbles and falls away.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
"Prompting." "Prompt engineering." The entire vocabulary that's sprung up around talking to AI has made it sound like a technical discipline. Like there's a right syntax. A correct formula. A sequence of magic words that, if you get them just right, will unlock the machine's true potential.

There isn't.

*[Beat.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
What there is—what has always worked—is clear communication. The same skill you use when you explain a project to a colleague, give directions to a contractor, or tell a new hire what you need.

You don't "prompt" your coworker. You talk to them. You explain what you need. They do their best. You look at it, give feedback, and they adjust. Back and forth. That's not a formula. It's a conversation.

AI works the same way.

*[Beat.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
The Sixty-Second Check from Module 3? That's how you start the conversation well. But starting well is only step one. What makes AI actually useful is what happens *after* the first response—the back and forth, the refining, the steering. That's where the real work lives.

And that's what nobody teaches. Every AI course in the world will give you templates for the perfect first message. Almost none of them will show you what to do when the response comes back and it's... close, but not right.

*[Beat.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
So let's do that.

---

## THE FIRST MOVE: GETTING IN THE DOOR

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
A conversation has to start somewhere. And where you start matters—not because it has to be perfect, but because it sets the direction.

*[VISUAL: The Sixty-Second Check reappears—familiar now.]*

**WHO** is going to read this?  
**WHAT** do I need it to say?  
**WHY** does it need to exist—what should happen after?  
**HOW** should it sound? What's my voice here?  
**WHAT NOT**—what would make this wrong?

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
You already know this. Think before you type. Make your tacit knowledge explicit. But now let's add something to it: your first message doesn't need to contain everything. It needs to contain *enough.* Enough for the machine to give you something worth responding to—something you can steer, shape, and build on.

Think of it like giving directions. You don't recite every turn from the starting point to the destination. You say "head north on Main, and I'll tell you where to turn." You get the direction right. The details come as you go.

*[Beat.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Every effective first message shares four elements. Not always in the same order. Not always in the same proportion. But they're always present.

*[VISUAL: Four elements building one at a time.]*

**Context.** Who is this for? What's the situation? What has already happened? This is your tacit knowledge, made explicit.

**Task.** What specifically do you need produced? Not "an email"—that's a format. A task is: write a follow-up that suggests a demo next Tuesday.

**Tone.** How should this sound? Not "professional"—we buried that word in Module 3. Something real: "short and warm, like a colleague you trust."

**Boundaries.** What should this *not* be? "Don't oversell." "Under 200 words." "Skip the pleasantries." Telling the machine what to avoid is often more powerful than telling it what to include.

*[Beat.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Context, Task, Tone, Boundaries. That's your opening move. Not a template to fill in—a mental checklist that makes sure you've said enough to get a response worth working with.

Now let's see what happens next.

---

## REWRITE #1: THE EMAIL — A CONVERSATION

*[SCENE: Joe's desk. He's back. Different week, new task. He needs to write an email to Lisa Park, a contact he met at a trade show, about scheduling a product demo.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Joe has learned a few things since we last saw him. Watch.

*[Joe pauses. Thinks. Types.]*

**JOE:** *(typing)* I need to email Lisa Park, Director of Procurement at Greenfield Industries. We met briefly at the NACS trade show last week—she stopped by our booth and asked about our inventory management system. She seemed most interested in the automated reorder feature. I want to suggest a 30-minute demo next week, Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon. Keep it short and warm—she was friendly and direct in person. Don't oversell. Just confirm her interest and make it easy to say yes.

*[The response appears. It's good. References the trade show. Mentions the feature. Suggests days. But something isn't quite right—it opens with "I hope this email finds you well" and closes with a paragraph about the company's "industry-leading solutions."]*

*[Joe reads it. Nods at the middle. Winces at the top and bottom.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Not bad. Not done.

Here's where most people make one of two mistakes. They either accept it as-is because it's "close enough," or they throw it out and start over from scratch. Both waste the progress they've already made.

Joe does neither.

*[Joe types again.]*

**JOE:** *(typing)* Good structure and the middle section works well. Two changes: cut the "I hope this email finds you well" opener—just get into it. And the last paragraph about our "industry-leading solutions" sounds like a brochure. Replace it with something simpler—just say I'd love to show her how the reorder feature works in practice, and ask if Tuesday or Wednesday works better.

*[The response updates. The opening is now direct—"Great meeting you at NACS last week." The close is simple: "Would Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon work for a 30-minute walkthrough?" Clean. Human. Effective.]*

*[Joe reads it. Changes one word—swaps "walkthrough" for "quick demo," because that's the language Lisa used at the booth. Hits send.]*

*[Beat.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Did you see what just happened? Not the first message—that was good. Look at the *second* message. Look at what Joe actually did.

*[VISUAL: Joe's second message highlights in segments.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
He told the machine what was working: "Good structure, the middle section works well." He identified what wasn't: the generic opener and the brochure language. And he gave specific direction for the fix: get into it, keep the close simple, focus on the feature.

He didn't start over. He didn't add adjectives. He gave *feedback.* The same way you'd give feedback to a colleague who handed you a solid first draft with a weak opening.

*[Beat.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
And then—this is the part that matters most—he changed one word himself. "Walkthrough" to "quick demo." Because he remembered that's how Lisa talked about it. That's his tacit knowledge making a micro-adjustment that no prompt could have produced. The machine got him 95% there. He closed the last 5% in two seconds.

That's not a failure of the machine. That's collaboration.

---

## THE SHAPE OF A CONVERSATION

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Let's name what's actually happening here, because it's the core skill of this entire module.

*[VISUAL: A simple diagram. Not a flowchart—more like a spiral or a back-and-forth zigzag.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Working with AI is not: write perfect prompt → receive perfect output. That almost never happens. And chasing that perfection is what makes people frustrated.

Working with AI is: start clear → evaluate what comes back → give feedback → evaluate again → refine until it's right. It's iterative. It's a conversation. And each turn of the conversation makes the output better, because each turn adds information the machine didn't have before.

*[Beat.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Your first message sets the direction. The machine's response shows you what it understood—and what it missed. Your *second* message is where you teach the machine what you actually need, because now you can see the gap between what you wanted and what you got. Your third message narrows the gap further.

Most good work with AI takes two to four exchanges. Not one. Not twenty. Just enough to close the distance between "close" and "right."

*[Beat.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
And here's the part that changes how you think about this: you don't have to know everything upfront. You don't have to write the perfect opening message. You just have to start with enough—and then *respond to what comes back.* The conversation fills in the gaps that your first message missed.

This is why "prompting" is the wrong metaphor. A prompt is a one-way instruction. A conversation is a collaboration. You're not programming a machine. You're working *with* it.

---

## REWRITE #2: THE SUMMARY — FINDING SIGNAL IN NOISE

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Let's try a different kind of task. Not an email—a summary.

*[SCENE: New character. Priya, mid-30s, project manager. She's just come out of a 90-minute stakeholder meeting. Her notes are a mess—half-sentences, abbreviations, tangents, action items buried in small talk.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Priya has ninety minutes of chaos and needs to turn it into something her director can skim in two minutes. This is one of the most powerful applications of AI—not because the machine is smarter than Priya, but because the machine can organize information at speed. The patterns are already in the data. The machine just needs Priya to tell it which patterns matter.

*[Priya types.]*

**PRIYA:** *(typing)* I need a meeting recap for the product team based on the notes I'll paste below. This was a 90-minute stakeholder review for the Q2 website redesign. The key decisions were: (1) we're keeping the March 15 launch date, (2) the hero section redesign is approved but the nav changes are pushed to Phase 2, (3) legal still needs to review the updated privacy language. Format it with a "Decisions" section, an "Open Items" section with owners and deadlines, and a "Parking Lot" for things we tabled. Keep it to one page. My director skims these—lead with what matters.

*[She pastes the messy notes. The summary comes back: structured, clear, decisions at top, open items with names and dates.]*

*[Priya reads it. It's good—but it attributed the privacy review to the wrong person.]*

**PRIYA:** *(typing)* This is solid. One correction—the privacy language review is owned by Sarah Kim in Legal, not Tom. Also, can you add the design vendor's revised delivery date (Feb 28) to the open items? I forgot to mention that.

*[Updated. Clean. Accurate now.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Two messages. The first gave structure and priorities. The second corrected a detail and added something she'd forgotten. Total time: four minutes. For a recap that would have taken her twenty to write from scratch.

*[Beat.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Notice what Priya did *not* do. She didn't ask the machine to "summarize the meeting." That would have produced a summary where every topic got equal weight—a shorter version of the mess, not a useful document. Instead, she told it what mattered. She was *in* the meeting. She knows which decisions were important and which tangents were noise. The machine can't make that judgment. Priya can.

The machine is not your analyst. It's your hands. You provide the intelligence—what matters, what doesn't, who owns what. It provides the speed—structure, formatting, clean prose at scale.

That division of labor is the whole game.

## WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WANT

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Now. Everything we've covered assumes you know what you want before you start. But here's a secret that nobody tells you about working with AI:

*[Beat.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Sometimes you don't. And that's fine.

*[VISUAL: A blank page. Cursor blinking.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Sometimes you have a task but no idea how to approach it. You know you need *something*—a plan, a structure, a first draft—but you can't articulate what "good" looks like because you haven't thought it through yet.

This is actually where AI conversations become most valuable. Not for producing output—for producing *clarity.*

*[Beat.]*

*[SCENE: Marcus, late 40s, runs a small landscaping company. He's sitting at his kitchen table with his phone, looking at Instagram, looking slightly lost.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Marcus runs a landscaping company in Raleigh. Twenty years of experience. He knows more about native plants and Carolina clay than most horticulture professors. His clients love him. His Instagram has twelve posts, all blurry photos of finished jobs with no captions.

He knows he needs social media content. He has no idea where to start.

*[Marcus types.]*

**MARCUS:** *(typing)* I run a landscaping company in Raleigh, NC. Mostly residential. Our specialty is native plant gardens that survive Carolina summers without constant watering. I need to do better on social media but I don't know what to post. What kinds of content would work for a business like mine?

*[The response comes back—not a finished product, but a list of content categories: seasonal tips, before/after project showcases, myth-busting common lawn care mistakes, native plant spotlights, behind-the-scenes process shots. Each with a brief explanation of why it works.]*

*[Marcus reads it. Something clicks.]*

**MARCUS:** *(typing)* The seasonal tips and myth-busting ones are closest to what I know. I'm always telling customers why they're killing their centipede grass by treating it like fescue. And we just finished a rain garden install in Cary that turned out great. Can you write 4 Instagram posts—one about centipede vs. fescue in the Triangle, one about the rain garden project, and two February lawn tips? Tone should be like I'm talking to a neighbor who asked for advice. I don't talk like a marketing brochure. No emojis. Short—under 150 words each.

*[The posts come back. They reference specific plants, specific geography, specific expertise. They sound like a person who actually knows dirt.]*

*[Marcus reads them, grins slightly, edits one to mention a specific variety of muhly grass he actually used in the Cary project.]*

*[Beat.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Watch what happened there. Marcus's first message wasn't a prompt—it was an honest admission: I don't know where to start. And the machine didn't write his content—it helped him *think.* It showed him categories. He recognized which ones matched his expertise. And *then* he had the clarity to direct the work.

The first message was a thinking aid. The second message was the real prompt. And it was only possible *because* of the first exchange.

*[Beat.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Marcus doesn't know what a context window is. He's never heard the term "prompt engineering." He just told the machine who he is, what he knows, and what he doesn't know. And the conversation did the rest.

This is the thing the AI industry doesn't want you to realize: there is no secret. There is no technique. There's just a person with domain knowledge—twenty years of understanding soil and seasons and what grows where—having a conversation with a tool that can turn that knowledge into finished work.

AI is a multiplier. It amplifies what you bring to the conversation. If you bring twenty years of expertise, you get content that sounds like an expert. If you bring nothing—no context, no knowledge, no specificity—you get nothing useful back. The machine can only multiply what's there.

---

## THE THREE FEEDBACK MOVES

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
So you've started a conversation. The first response came back. It's close but not right. Now what?

*[Beat.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
You have three moves. Only three. And knowing which one to use is the difference between productive iteration and going in circles.

*[VISUAL: Three moves appearing.]*

**Move one: Steer.**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
The direction is wrong. The machine misunderstood your intent, or you weren't clear enough about what you wanted. Steering means redirecting. "This is too formal—I need something more conversational." "You focused on the timeline, but the real issue is the budget." "This is a summary, but I need it to be a recommendation."

Steering changes *what* the machine is doing. Use it when the output is answering the wrong question.

**Move two: Refine.**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
The direction is right, but the details are off. Refining means adjusting without starting over. "Good, but the opening paragraph is too long—tighten it to two sentences." "Replace the bullet points with a narrative format." "The tone is right in the first half but gets stiff in the second."

Refining sharpens what's already working. Use it when the output is answering the right question imprecisely.

**Move three: Extend.**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
The output is good, and now you want more. Extending means building on what's there. "Now write a version of this for a technical audience." "Can you add a section on risks and mitigation?" "Great—now take the same information and format it as talking points for a meeting."

Extending adds to what the machine has already understood. Use it when the foundation is solid and you need to build on it.

*[Beat.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Steer, Refine, Extend. Every productive second message falls into one of these three categories. And notice—none of them are "make it better." That's not a feedback move. That's a vibe. And we know what vibes produce.

---

## THE COMMON TRAPS

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Before we move on, three traps that catch people even when they're having good conversations with AI. Quick, so you can spot them.

*[VISUAL: Three traps, fast.]*

**Trap one: The restart reflex.**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
The output isn't what you wanted, so you delete everything and start over. This throws away everything the machine already learned about your task. Instead, *steer.* Tell it what's wrong. Redirect. The machine builds on what came before—use that.

**Trap two: The infinite loop.**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
"Make it more professional." "No, less stiff." "More professional, but warmer." "No, not like that." If you've gone back and forth more than three times on the same issue and it's not getting closer, the problem isn't the machine. It's that you haven't defined what you want in concrete terms. Stop. Think. Write down what "right" actually looks like. Then try once with specifics instead of adjectives.

**Trap three: Accepting "good enough" too early.**

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
The output sounds smooth. It reads well. It's... fine? The temptation is to hit send because the machine produced something that looks professional. But remember Margaret. "Sounds impressive" and "serves your purpose" are different things. Before you accept output, ask: does this sound like *me*? Does it say what *I* need it to say? Would I send this if I'd written it myself?

If the answer is no, you have one more turn of conversation to make it right.

---

## THE PRACTICE

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Here's what we'd like you to do—right now, or as soon as you can after this module.

*[VISUAL: Simple instructions on screen.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Think of a real task from your actual work. Not a test exercise—something on your to-do list this week.

Run the Sixty-Second Check. Write your first message. Context, Task, Tone, Boundaries. It doesn't have to be perfect. It just has to be specific enough to start.

Then read what comes back. Not with the question "is this good?"—with specific questions: Did it get the audience right? Is the tone what I asked for? Does it include what I needed and exclude what I didn't?

Then give feedback. Steer, Refine, or Extend. Have the conversation. See where two or three exchanges take you.

*[Beat.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
The first time you do this, it might feel slow. You're thinking about things you used to do on autopilot. That's normal. That's the tacit-to-explicit shift we talked about in Module 3. It's unfamiliar.

By the third time, it's faster. By the tenth, it's instinct. And by then, you'll wonder how you ever typed "write me an email" and expected something useful back.

---

## END CARD

*[VISUAL: Module 4 summary card.]*

**Key Concepts:**

- "Prompting" is a misleading word—you're having a conversation
- The Sixty-Second Check starts the conversation; what comes next is where the real work happens
- Four elements of a good opening: Context, Task, Tone, Boundaries
- Your first message doesn't have to be perfect—it has to be specific enough to start
- You can use AI to think, not just to produce—ask for options before giving instructions
- AI is a multiplier: it amplifies the domain knowledge you bring
- Three feedback moves: Steer (redirect), Refine (sharpen), Extend (build on)
- "Make it better" is not feedback. Specifics are feedback.
- Two to four exchanges is normal. One-shot perfection is the exception, not the goal.

## MODULE 4 QUIZ

**Question 1:**  
Joe's first AI response has a good structure but opens with a generic greeting and closes with brochure language. What should Joe do?  
- A) Delete everything and start over with a better prompt  
- B) Add "make it less generic" to his original prompt and resubmit  
- C) Tell the AI what's working, identify what isn't, and give specific direction for the fix  
- D) Accept it as-is—it's close enough  

**Correct Answer: C**

**Question 2:**  
Marcus doesn't know what social media content to create for his landscaping business. His best first message to AI is:  
- A) "Write me some social media posts for a landscaping company"  
- B) "What kinds of social media content work for a small residential landscaping business in the Southeast?"  
- C) "Create a viral social media strategy that will get me thousands of followers"  
- D) "Make me 10 detailed, engaging, professional social media posts"  

**Correct Answer: B**

**Question 3:**  
You've asked AI to draft a project update. The response focuses on the timeline, but the real issue is budget. This is a situation where you should:  
- A) Refine—adjust the details within the current direction  
- B) Extend—add a budget section to the existing draft  
- C) Steer—redirect the AI because it's answering the wrong question  
- D) Start over with a completely new prompt  

**Correct Answer: C**

**Question 4 (Scenario):**  
You've gone back and forth with AI four times about the tone of an email. It's still not right. The most likely problem is:  
- A) The AI model isn't powerful enough for this task  
- B) You need to switch to a different AI tool  
- C) You haven't defined what the right tone actually looks like in specific, concrete terms  
- D) The AI is deliberately ignoring your instructions  

**Correct Answer: C**

## NOTES FOR PRODUCTION

**Part Two opening:**
- Energy shift from Part One. Part One was reflective, philosophical. Part Two is sleeves-rolled-up. Same narrator voice, but the tone says: now we work.
- Keep the Part Two intro under 30 seconds.

**Cold open:**
- Two people side by side. One commanding, one conversing. The contrast should be visible in body language—the commander is tense, leaning forward, jabbing at the keyboard. The conversationalist is relaxed, reading, responding naturally.
- Under 60 seconds. The visual tells the story before the narrator explains it.

**"Forget the word prompting" section:**
- This is the thesis of the module. Hit it hard and clear. The audience has likely absorbed "prompt engineering" from a hundred YouTube videos and blog posts. We're deliberately dismantling that framing.
- "You don't prompt your coworker. You talk to them." This line needs to land.

**Joe's email conversation:**
- Joe's growth since Module 3 should be visible but not narrated. Don't say "Joe has learned." Show him pausing, thinking, typing with intention. The audience will see the change.
- The SECOND message is the key teaching moment. Linger on it. Show what good feedback looks like: "what's working, what isn't, specific fix."
- Joe's one-word edit ("walkthrough" to "quick demo") is important. It's the human contribution that no prompt can replace. Don't rush past it.

**Priya's summary:**
- The messy notes should look genuinely messy. Real meeting notes, not a cleaned-up version. The audience should recognize their own note-taking chaos.
- "The machine is not your analyst. It's your hands." — This line carries weight. The division of labor (human intelligence + machine speed) is the thesis of every good AI workflow.

**Marcus section:**
- Marcus matters because he proves domain knowledge is the real input, not technical sophistication. A landscaper who knows his soil is a better AI collaborator than a tech worker who doesn't know their own expertise.
- His first message ("I don't know what to post") should feel honest, not dumb. This is someone being smart enough to ask for help thinking.
- The shift from his first message (exploring) to his second message (directing) is the arc of the whole module in miniature.
- "AI is a multiplier" is a key line. Let it resonate.

**Three feedback moves:**
- Steer, Refine, Extend. Simple taxonomy. Don't overcomplicate.
- "None of them are 'make it better'" should get a knowing laugh from the audience.
- These three moves replace the vague instinct most people have of "try again" or "start over." Giving them names makes them usable.

**Three traps:**
- Quick. Punchy. Under 90 seconds total for all three.
- The restart reflex is the most common. The infinite loop is the most frustrating. Accepting too early is the most dangerous (because it produces work that *looks* fine but doesn't serve the purpose).

**Practice exercise:**
- First time we ask the audience to actually DO something conversational with AI. Emphasize "real task, not a test exercise."
- The evaluation questions ("Did it get the audience right?") are a preview of Module 5's taste/standards work.

**Pacing:**
- Part Two opening: ~30 sec
- Cold open: ~1 min
- Forget "prompting" / thesis: ~3 min
- First move / four elements: ~2 min
- Joe's email conversation: ~5 min
- Shape of a conversation: ~2 min
- Priya's summary: ~4 min
- Marcus / when you don't know: ~5 min
- Three feedback moves: ~3 min
- Three traps: ~1.5 min
- Practice exercise: ~2 min
- Target total: ~29 min (allow ±2 min)

**Tone throughout:**
- Practical. Energetic. The narrator's stance has shifted from "let me show you the problem" to "let me show you how this works."
- Conversational about conversation. The module should feel like it practices what it preaches—a back-and-forth between narrator and audience, not a lecture.
- Every example should feel like something the audience does this week, not a theoretical exercise.
