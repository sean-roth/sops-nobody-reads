# Module 3: The Problem Is You (And That's Good News)

**Duration:** 25-30 minutes  
**Part:** One - Know Thy Machine

---

## COLD OPEN

*[SCENE: Joe's desk. Monday morning. Coffee, slightly rumpled shirt, a client email he needs to reply to. He opens Claude.]*

**JOE:** *(typing)* Write me an email.

*[Beat. The response appears. "Dear [Recipient], I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to follow up regarding our recent discussion..."]*

*[Joe frowns. Deletes. Tries again.]*

**JOE:** *(typing)* Write me a good email.

*[Response appears. Different greeting. Same emptiness. Slightly warmer phrasing, zero substance.]*

*[Joe sighs. Cracks his knuckles. One more try.]*

**JOE:** *(typing)* Write me a really good, professional email that will impress my client.

*[Response appears. Now it's got bigger words. More formal phrasing. It sounds like a press release that was written by a committee and edited by a lawyer. It's "impressive" the way a résumé written in the third person is impressive—technically correct, humanly wrong.]*

*[Joe stares at the screen. He gestures at it, palms up, as if the machine has personally betrayed him.]*

**JOE:** *(to no one)* Why is this thing so... *bad?*

*[FREEZE FRAME on Joe's exasperated face.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Joe has asked three times. He's gotten three answers. And he's zero for three.

But here's the thing nobody has told Joe yet.

*[TITLE CARD: "The Problem Is You (And That's Good News)"]*

## THE DIAGNOSIS

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Let's look at what Joe actually typed.

*[VISUAL: Joe's three prompts appear on screen, stacked vertically.]*

Attempt one: "Write me an email."  
Attempt two: "Write me a good email."  
Attempt three: "Write me a really good, professional email that will impress my client."

*[Beat.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Notice what changed between attempts. He added adjectives. Good. Really good. Professional. Impressive. More adjectives, bigger adjectives, stacked on top of each other like a child putting extra candles on a birthday cake hoping it'll make the cake taste better.

*[VISUAL: Each adjective highlights and floats off the prompt, leaving the bare request behind.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Now notice what *didn't* change. He never said who the email was to. He never said what it was about. He never mentioned the proposal, the client's concerns, the meeting last Tuesday, the relationship they'd built over two years, or what he actually needed to communicate.

He gave the machine more *decoration* and zero additional *information.*

*[Beat.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
This is like walking into a restaurant and saying "bring me food." When the waiter brings something you don't like, you say "no—bring me *good* food." And when that doesn't work: "bring me *really excellent* food that I'll *love.*"

*[VISUAL: 1950s-style diner. A bewildered waiter holding a plate. Joe pointing at it, dissatisfied.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
At no point did you mention that you're allergic to shellfish, that you had Italian for lunch, or that you're celebrating an anniversary. You just kept adding adjectives to the word "food" and wondering why the kitchen can't read your mind.

The kitchen isn't psychic. Neither is the machine.

## THE UNCOMFORTABLE TRUTH

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Here's the part that stings a little.

*[VISUAL: A mirror. Joe's reflection looking back at him.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
The problem isn't the AI.

*[Beat.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
The AI did exactly what it was designed to do. It took the input it received and completed the pattern. "Write me an email" is a pattern that matches millions of generic emails in its training data. So that's what it produced. A perfectly average email, drawn from the great ocean of perfectly average emails that humans have been writing since the invention of electronic mail.

You asked for average. You got average. The machine didn't fail. It *succeeded*—at the wrong task. Because you gave it the wrong task.

*[Beat.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
But here's why this is good news.

*[VISUAL: The mirror cracks—and behind it, a door opens. Light spills through.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
If the problem were the technology—if AI were simply bad at writing emails—you'd be stuck. Nothing you could do. Wait for a better model, complain on the internet, go back to doing everything yourself.

But the problem isn't the technology. The problem is upstream of the technology. The problem is what happens—or doesn't happen—between the moment you decide you need an email and the moment your fingers touch the keyboard.

*[VISUAL: A gap. A visible empty space between "I need an email" (thought bubble) and Joe typing.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
There's a step missing. And that step has a name.

*[VISUAL: The word appears in the empty space, filling it.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Thinking.

---

## CLEAR THINKING PRECEDES CLEAR PROMPTING

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
This is the single most important sentence in this entire course. If you remember nothing else from these modules, remember this:

*[VISUAL: The sentence appears in bold, period-appropriate typography—perhaps styled like a public service announcement poster.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Clear thinking precedes clear prompting.

*[Beat.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Not prompt engineering. Not magic words. Not templates or frameworks or secret techniques. *Thinking.* The boring, difficult, unglamorous work of figuring out what you actually want before you ask a machine to produce it.

*[VISUAL: Return to Joe at his desk, replaying the cold open—but this time, we see inside his head. The context he already knows but didn't share.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Let's look at what was already inside Joe's head when he typed "write me an email."

*[VISUAL: Each piece of context appearing around Joe's head, like thought bubbles or floating notecards.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
He knew the email was going to Margaret Chen, VP of Operations at Consolidated Manufacturing. He knew it was about following up on Tuesday's meeting where he'd presented a proposal for streamlining their shipping documentation. He knew Margaret liked the concept but had concerns about implementation timeline and the training burden on her staff. He knew he wanted her to schedule a follow-up meeting to work through those details. He knew his relationship with Margaret was warm and direct—they'd worked together for two years, shared jokes at conferences, built real professional trust.

*[VISUAL: All of this context, floating around Joe's head, vivid and detailed. Then: Joe's actual prompt appearing at the bottom of the screen: "Write me an email." The contrast is stark.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Joe knew all of this. Every bit of it. It was sitting right there in his head—completely available, entirely relevant, and utterly unshared.

*[Beat.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
And here's the thing—this isn't because Joe is lazy. It's because when Joe writes an email himself, he doesn't consciously think through all this context. It's automatic. He knows Margaret. He knows the project. His brain integrates all of it without explicit effort, and his fingers produce an email that reflects everything he knows.

But the machine isn't Joe. The machine knows nothing about Margaret, nothing about shipping documentation, nothing about Tuesday's meeting, nothing about their rapport. Remember Module 1? The machine sees only what's in the current conversation. Everything else is darkness.

Joe's mistake isn't laziness. It's *assumption.* He assumed the AI could access the same context his own brain accesses automatically. As if thinking it were the same as typing it.

It isn't.

## WRITING IS THINKING MADE VISIBLE

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Now. This problem goes deeper than prompts. Much deeper.

*[VISUAL: An old typewriter. A pen and inkwell. A modern keyboard. Tools for making thought visible across the ages.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
There's a concept that writers and teachers have understood for centuries: writing is thinking made visible. The act of putting words on a page isn't just *recording* your thoughts—it's *forming* them. You don't fully know what you think until you try to write it down.

This is why a journal helps you process emotions you couldn't name. Why writing a business plan reveals gaps you hadn't noticed. Why explaining a problem in an email sometimes solves the problem before you hit send.

*[Beat.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
And this is why a vague prompt produces vague output. Not because the machine is stupid, but because a vague prompt reveals vague *thinking.* If you can't articulate what you want in words, you don't actually know what you want yet. You have a *feeling* about what you want. An intuition. A vibe.

Vibes are not instructions.

*[VISUAL: A neon sign that says "VIBES" flickering and going dark. Replaced by a clean, solid sign: "INSTRUCTIONS."]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Watch what happens when the gap between feeling and language catches up with Joe.

*[SCENE: Joe, reviewing an AI-generated draft. Something's off, but he can't quite name it.]*

**JOE:** *(typing)* Make it more professional.

*[The AI adjusts. Removes contractions. Adds "pursuant to our conversation" and "please do not hesitate to reach out."]*

*[Joe winces.]*

**JOE:** *(typing)* No, not like that. More... professional. But not stiff.

*[The AI adjusts again. Loosens slightly. Still wrong. A different flavor of wrong.]*

**JOE:** *(typing)* You know what I mean!

*[FREEZE FRAME.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
It doesn't. And here's the uncomfortable part: neither does Joe.

*[Beat.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
"Professional" is one of the most common words people use when directing AI. It's also one of the most meaningless.

*[VISUAL: The word "PROFESSIONAL" in large type, center screen. Then it fractures—splitting into dozens of possible interpretations, scattering across the screen.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
To a lawyer, "professional" means precise citations and careful hedging. To a startup founder, it means confident and forward-looking. To a nurse, it means empathetic but boundaried. To Joe, it means... something. Something he'd recognize if he saw it. Something he can feel but can't define.

And that feeling—that "I'll know it when I see it" sensation—is not something he can transmit through a text box.

*[Beat.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Let's try a quick experiment. Think of a word you use often when describing what you want from writing. "Professional." "Casual." "Polished." "Better." "Cleaner." "Punchy."

Now try to define it. Not with another vague word—with specific, concrete instructions that a stranger could follow. What does "professional" actually mean in *your* context? Fewer contractions? Shorter sentences? More data? Different vocabulary? A specific structure?

*[Beat. Give the learner a real moment here.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
If you found that difficult, you've just discovered something important. You've located the gap. And that gap—between what you feel and what you can articulate—is where most AI "failures" live.

Not in the machine. In the space between your intuition and your words.

## KNOW THYSELF

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Which brings us to the deepest layer.

*[VISUAL: An ancient Greek temple. Carved into the stone above the entrance: ΓΝΩΘΙ ΣΑΥΤΟΝ.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Two thousand years ago, at the Oracle of Delphi—you'll recall our mythology from Module 1—two words were carved above the temple entrance. "Know Thyself." The Greeks considered it the beginning of all wisdom.

Turns out, it's also the beginning of effective AI use.

*[Beat.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Because here's the question underneath everything we've discussed. If you can't clearly define what good writing looks like in *your* context—your voice, your standards, your audience—how will you know when the machine gets it right?

*[SCENE: Joe, reading a freshly generated email. It's polished. Crisp sentences. Confident assertions. It sounds... smart? Authoritative? He nods. Hits send.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Joe just sent an email that sounds impressive. Big vocabulary. Smooth phrasing. The kind of email you'd find in a "professional communication" textbook.

It sounds nothing like Joe.

*[SCENE: Margaret Chen at her desk. She opens the email. Reads the first line. Pauses. Reads it again. Her brow furrows—not in offense. In confusion. She's reading something that doesn't match two years of emails from someone she knows.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Margaret has received dozens of emails from Joe. She knows his voice. Direct. A little warm. Occasionally wry. Gets to the point without being curt. The person in this email is someone she's never met.

*[Beat.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Because no person wrote it. A pattern completion system produced text matching the statistical average of "professional follow-up emails" from its training data. It doesn't know Joe's voice, because Joe never told it. And Joe never told it because—and this is the real issue—Joe has never defined his voice to *himself.*

*[VISUAL: Two emails side by side. Left: the AI-generated version—polished, generic, interchangeable. Right: what Joe's actual voice sounds like when he's writing at his best—direct, warm, specific, human.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Most people have never articulated their own communication style. They've never had to. When you write your own emails, your voice emerges automatically—it's built into how you think, how you structure sentences, which words you reach for and which you'd never use. You don't think about it. It just happens.

But the moment you hand that task to a machine, "it just happens" stops working. Now you need to know what "sounding like you" actually means—in concrete, describable terms—so you can direct the machine toward it.

*[Beat.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
This is what we mean by "taste." Not taste in the abstract, art-gallery, wine-tasting sense. Taste as a practical, everyday skill: the ability to look at a piece of output and know whether it's *right.* Not because you have an opinion—everyone has opinions—but because you have *standards.* Criteria. A measuring stick that exists *before* the output arrives.

Without that measuring stick, you're left with a single, dangerously unreliable criterion: "does this sound impressive?" And as Joe just demonstrated, "sounds impressive" and "serves my actual purpose" are very different things.

One lands a follow-up meeting with Margaret. The other makes Margaret wonder if Joe's been replaced by a robot.

## THE FIX

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
So. We've diagnosed the problem. Three layers deep.

*[VISUAL: Three layers appearing, stacking from bottom to top like a cross-section diagram.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
**Layer one:** You're not telling the machine what you actually need. You're adding adjectives instead of information.

**Layer two:** You can't tell the machine what you need because you haven't thought it through yourself. The vague prompt reveals vague thinking.

**Layer three:** Even when the machine produces something, you can't reliably evaluate it because you haven't defined what good looks like for your specific context.

*[Beat.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Three layers. One fix. And it's not a template. It's not a trick. It's a habit.

*[VISUAL: Simple, clear text, perhaps handwritten on a notecard or index card.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Before you type, think. Before you think, ask yourself questions.

*[Beat.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Not a lot of questions. Not a twenty-minute meditation. Just a moment of clarity. Sixty seconds. Sometimes less.

*[VISUAL: The card fills in—clean, practical, memorable.]*

**The Sixty-Second Check:**

**WHO** is going to read this?  
**WHAT** do I need it to say?  
**WHY** does it need to exist—what should happen after?  
**HOW** should it sound? What's my voice here?  
**WHAT NOT**—what would make this wrong?

*[Beat.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
That's it. Five questions. Sixty seconds. You answer them for yourself—and then you share the answers with the machine.

You're not learning prompt engineering. You're learning to think clearly under pressure—a skill that will serve you whether you're talking to an AI, writing an email yourself, or explaining a project to a new colleague.

The AI just makes the skill non-optional.

## BACK TO JOE

*[SCENE: Joe's desk. Friday. Same desk, same coffee, different email to write. But something's different. Joe doesn't start typing immediately.]*

*[He pulls out an index card—maybe the same one from the framework. He jots a few things down. We see what he writes:]*

*"Margaret Chen. Follow-up re: shipping docs proposal. She's worried about timeline + training her staff. I want a meeting next week. Tone: like my normal emails—direct, warm, not stiff."*

*[He turns to the screen. Takes a breath. Types.]*

**JOE:** *(typing)* I need to write a follow-up email to Margaret Chen, VP of Operations at Consolidated Manufacturing. We met Tuesday about my proposal for streamlining their shipping documentation. She liked the concept but had concerns about implementation timeline and the training burden on her staff. I want to acknowledge those concerns briefly and suggest we meet next week to work through the details together. My tone with Margaret is direct and warm—we've worked together for two years and have a good rapport. Think less "formal business letter" and more "trusted colleague." Keep it under 200 words.

*[The response appears. It's... good. Specific. It references Margaret's actual concerns. It has a clear ask. It sounds like something a real human would send to someone they actually know.]*

*[Joe reads it. Nods slowly. Changes one word—swaps "schedule" for "find time for," because that's how he'd say it. Adjusts the sign-off from "Best regards" to "Talk soon"—because that's how he closes emails with Margaret.]*

*[He hits send. Leans back. The whole thing—thinking, typing, reviewing, editing—took four minutes.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
Same Joe. Same AI. Same task.

The only thing that changed was that Joe spent sixty seconds knowing what he wanted before asking for it.

*[Beat.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
The machine didn't get smarter between Monday and Friday. Joe got *clearer.* And clear thinking, it turns out, is the only prompt engineering that matters.

*[Beat.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**  
And notice something else. Joe still made edits. He changed a word. He adjusted the sign-off. He didn't just accept the output—he directed it, refined it, made it his own. Because he knew what "his own" sounded like.

That's not a failure of the AI. That's the process working exactly as it should. We'll have much more to say about this in Part Two.

*[FADE OUT]*

- Vague prompts reveal vague thinking: writing makes the gap visible
- Words like "professional," "good," and "better" are feelings, not instructions
- You can't evaluate AI output without first defining what good looks like
- Know your voice, your standards, your audience—before you ask the machine
- The Sixty-Second Check: WHO, WHAT, WHY, HOW, WHAT NOT

## MODULE 3 QUIZ

**Question 1:**  
Joe types "Write me a good email" and gets generic output. The most likely reason is:  
- A) The AI isn't capable of writing good emails  
- B) Joe didn't pay for the premium version  
- C) Joe provided no context about who it was for, what it was about, or how it should sound  
- D) The AI was having a bad day  

**Correct Answer: C**

**Question 2:**  
When Joe asks the AI to "make it more professional," the core problem is:  
- A) The AI doesn't understand the word "professional"  
- B) "Professional" means different things in different contexts and Joe hasn't defined what he means  
- C) The AI is ignoring Joe's instructions  
- D) Joe needs a different AI tool  

**Correct Answer: B**

**Question 3:**  
Joe sends an AI-generated email to a long-time client. The client thinks it sounds unlike Joe. This happened because:  
- A) The AI deliberately changed Joe's voice  
- B) Joe never defined his communication style, so the AI produced statistically average text  
- C) The AI was trained on bad email examples  
- D) Joe's client is being unreasonable  

**Correct Answer: B**

**Question 4 (Scenario):**  
Sarah needs AI help writing a project update. Which approach will produce the best result?  
- A) "Write me a project update"  
- B) "Write me an amazing, detailed, impressive project update"  
- C) "I need a 1-page update for my director on the website redesign project. We're on track for the March deadline, but the vendor is 2 weeks behind on the design mockups, which I've escalated. Tone should be factual and solutions-oriented—my director values brevity and hates surprises. Include a risk section and next steps."  
- D) "Please write the best project update you possibly can"  

**Correct Answer: C**

## END OF PART ONE

*[VISUAL: Part One completion card.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
You've now completed Part One: Know Thy Machine.

You understand what AI actually is—alien intelligence, fluent in your language but fundamentally unlike you. You understand what it isn't—not a person, not a search engine, not a mind that remembers you. And you understand why most people struggle with it—not because the technology fails, but because clear thinking and clear communication were always the prerequisites, and nobody mentioned that.

*[Beat.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
Part Two will show you how to put all of this into practice. How to stop treating AI like a search engine and start collaborating with it. How to verify what it gives you. How to build it into your actual workflow. And the rules of the road you need to follow to use it responsibly.

But the foundation is laid. You know what you're working with. And you know that the most important upgrade isn't in the software.

It's in you.

## NOTES FOR PRODUCTION

**Cold open:**
- The three-strike sequence should be FAST. Almost comedic timing. Type, response, frown. Type, response, sigh. Type, response, exasperated gesture. Under 90 seconds total.
- Joe's frustration should be deeply relatable—the audience should recognize themselves, maybe wince a little. This isn't watching someone be dumb. It's watching someone make a mistake you've made.
- The third attempt—piling on adjectives—should land as mild comedy. The audience should see the absurdity before the narrator points it out.

**Restaurant metaphor:**
- Brief. Punchy. Don't belabor it. One visual beat—1950s diner, bewildered waiter—and move on. The audience should get the analogy instantly.

**"Clear thinking" section:**
- The floating context around Joe's head is the key visual of the whole module. Everything he knows, vivid and detailed, orbiting his head—while the text box below shows only "Write me an email." The contrast is the argument. Make it stark.
- This section should feel revelatory, not accusatory. Narrator's tone: "look at everything you already knew—you just forgot to share it."

**"Writing is thinking" section:**
- This is the intellectual heart. Don't rush.
- The word "PROFESSIONAL" shattering into dozens of meanings is a signature visual moment. Linger on it.
- The learner exercise (define your own vague words) should feel like a genuine pause. Leave three to five seconds of quiet. Let them actually try it.
- "Vibes are not instructions" should land with a beat of humor. Brief visual gag and move on.

**"Know Thyself" section:**
- The Oracle at Delphi reference ties back to Module 1's mythology thread. This is deliberate thematic continuity—the old stories remain relevant.
- Margaret reading the email: her reaction is confusion, not offense. Subtle. She's not angry, she's just... not recognizing the person who supposedly wrote this. This is a quiet beat, not a dramatic one.
- The two-email comparison (generic vs. Joe's actual voice) needs to be vivid. The audience should immediately see the difference and feel the "oh no" of sending the wrong one.

**Joe's redemption:**
- The index card moment is crucial for accessibility. He's not using a complex system. Not opening a spreadsheet. Not following a 12-step framework. He's jotting five things on a card with a pen. Anyone can do this tomorrow.
- His two small edits at the end are important foreshadowing. Even good AI output gets refined. The human still shapes the final product. This theme will expand significantly in Part Two.
- The four-minute total time should register—this process is *faster* than fighting with vague prompts, not slower.

**Part One conclusion:**
- The closing narration should feel like a genuine accomplishment. Three modules, three core insights, a real foundation.
- "The most important upgrade isn't in the software. It's in you." — This is the thesis of Part One and the bridge to Part Two. Deliver it with warmth, not cheese.
- CTA should be natural, not salesy. The learner should *want* Part Two because they now understand the problem and want the tools to fix it.

**Tone throughout:**
- This module delivers an uncomfortable message: "the problem is you." The warmth must be real, never condescending.
- The "(And That's Good News)" reframe is essential. If the audience feels blamed, you've lost them. If they feel empowered, you've won.
- Narrator should sound like a wise friend sharing a useful truth, not a teacher scolding a student.

**Pacing:**
- Cold open / three strikes: ~2 min
- Diagnosis / restaurant metaphor: ~3 min
- Uncomfortable truth / good news reframe: ~3 min
- Clear thinking section: ~6 min
- Writing is thinking: ~6 min
- Know thyself: ~5 min
- The fix / sixty-second check: ~2 min
- Joe's redemption: ~3 min
- Part One conclusion: ~2 min
- Target total: ~30 min (allow ±2 min)

**Visual continuity across Part One:**
- Module 1 introduced mythology (oracles, genies, trickster gods). Module 3 callbacks with the Oracle at Delphi's "Know Thyself." Thread maintained across all three modules.
- Module 2 introduced theater/directing as a metaphor. Module 3 briefly echoes this—Joe is still performing badly, and his redemption is a better "performance." Thread maintained.
- Module 1's context window concept pays off concretely here: Joe now understands in practical terms what it means to fill that window with useful information.

**Music / sound notes:**
- Light comedy under cold open (vaudeville-style timing for the three strikes)
- Slight gravity, but warmth, under "the uncomfortable truth"
- Intellectual curiosity under "writing is thinking"—the sound of realizing something
- Quiet unease under Margaret reading the wrong-sounding email
- Clean clarity under "the fix"—the fog lifts
- Satisfaction and resolution under Joe's redemption
- Part One conclusion: something that feels like completion but also anticipation. A chapter ending, not a story ending.
