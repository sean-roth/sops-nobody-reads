# So You Want to Work with AI!

**A Comprehensive Guide to Not Failing Miserably**

An AI onboarding course for business professionals that addresses the real barriers to effective AI adoption—not just the tools, but the thinking skills that make the tools useful.

## Project Status

🚧 **In Development** - Planning phase

## The Problem This Course Solves

Most AI training teaches the external mechanics (prompts, interfaces, features) while ignoring the internal prerequisites (clear thinking, written communication, self-awareness). The result: people complete courses but still can't get useful output from AI.

This course flips the script. We address why people fail before teaching them how to succeed.

## Target Audience

- Business professionals new to AI or struggling to get value from it
- Teams being asked to "adopt AI" without guidance
- Managers who need to train their staff
- Anyone who's concluded "AI doesn't work" after frustrating experiences

## Course Philosophy

1. **Prerequisites matter more than prompts** - Clear thinking precedes clear prompting
2. **Show failure first** - People learn better from watching mistakes than lectures
3. **AI is alien intelligence** - Fluent in your language, but fundamentally not like you
4. **The human is the product** - AI amplifies your judgment; your judgment is still required

## Aesthetic Direction

1950s-60s instructional film style:
- Narrator with period-appropriate voice and cadence
- Hapless protagonist "Bob from Accounting" demonstrating every mistake
- "What NOT to do" segments followed by corrective explanations
- Disarming, memorable, non-condescending
