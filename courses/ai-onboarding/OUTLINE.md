# Course Outline: So You Want to Work with AI!

**Estimated Total Runtime:** 6-8 hours (comprehensive, with exercises)

---

## PART ONE: KNOW THY MACHINE
*Before you can fail properly, you must understand what you're failing with*

### Module 1: What Is This Thing, Anyway?
**Duration:** 25-30 min

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand what an LLM actually is (without needing to code)
- Recognize why AI sounds human but isn't human
- Grasp the implications of pattern completion for your work

**Content:**
- The alien intelligence concept: fluent in your language, but not like you
- Pattern completion vs. understanding—what that actually means for you
- Why it sounds confident about everything, including nonsense
- The training process in plain terms (not technical, but accurate)
- What it can see, what it remembers, what it forgets (context windows, no persistence)

**Bob Scenario:** Bob asks Claude "Do you remember what we talked about yesterday?" and is confused when it doesn't.

---

### Module 2: The Ghost in the Machine (There Isn't One)
**Duration:** 20-25 min

**Learning Objectives:**
- Stop anthropomorphizing AI in ways that lead to misuse
- Understand why the same question yields different answers
- Recognize that effective use requires a skilled operator

**Content:**
- Why anthropomorphizing leads you astray
- It has no goals, no memory of you, no feelings about your project
- The "helpful assistant" persona is a design choice, not a personality
- Probabilistic output: why you can ask the same question twice and get different answers
- The implications: it's a tool that requires a skilled operator

**Bob Scenario:** Bob gets offended when Claude "changes its mind" and accuses it of being inconsistent. He doesn't realize he's arguing with statistics.

---

## PART TWO: THE PREREQUISITES NOBODY MENTIONS
*The uncomfortable truth about why "AI isn't working" for you*

### Module 3: The Problem Isn't the AI, Bob
**Duration:** 30-35 min

**Learning Objectives:**
- Recognize that unclear thinking produces unclear prompts
- Develop the habit of clarifying intent before typing
- Break the "vague request, disappointing result" cycle

**Content:**
- Clear thinking precedes clear prompting
- If you don't know what you want, neither does the machine
- The "vague request, disappointing result" cycle
- Exercise: Articulate what you actually need before touching the keyboard

**Bob Scenario:** Bob types "write me an email" and gets generic slop. He tries "write me a GOOD email" and gets slightly better slop. He concludes AI is useless.

**Exercise:** Before/after comparison. Learner writes what they want, then refines it through guided questions, then sees the difference in output.

---

### Module 4: Writing Is Thinking Made Visible
**Duration:** 25-30 min

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand why written communication skills predict AI effectiveness
- Identify ambiguity in your own requests
- Practice specificity as a skill

**Content:**
- Why written communication skills directly predict AI effectiveness
- Ambiguity in, garbage out
- Specificity as a learnable skill
- The gap between what you meant and what you typed

**Bob Scenario:** Bob says "make it more professional" and is frustrated when the AI doesn't read his mind about what "professional" means in his specific context.

**Exercise:** Ambiguity audit. Learner reviews their own past prompts (or provided examples) and identifies every ambiguous word or assumption.

---

### Module 5: Know Thyself (Seriously)
**Duration:** 30-35 min

**Learning Objectives:**
- Define your own voice, standards, and quality criteria
- Develop the ability to evaluate AI output against your standards
- Understand "taste" as a concrete, developable skill

**Content:**
- Your voice, your standards, your intentions
- Why you can't evaluate output if you don't know what good looks like
- Developing taste: the skill nobody teaches
- Exercise: Define quality for your own work before asking AI to produce it

**Bob Scenario:** Bob accepts AI output because it "sounds smart" even though it doesn't match his company's voice or his actual position on the topic.

**Exercise:** Quality definition worksheet. Learner articulates what makes writing good in THEIR context—tone, length, evidence standards, audience expectations.

## PART THREE: THE FASTEST WAYS TO FAIL
*A comprehensive catalog of mistakes, demonstrated by our friend Bob*

### Module 6: The One-Shot Catastrophe
**Duration:** 25-30 min

**Learning Objectives:**

- The conversation you're not having
- Why iteration isn't optional—it's the whole point
- Demo: Same task, one-shot vs. iterative approaches

**Bob Scenario:** Bob types a query, gets a response, sighs, and closes the tab. He never considers saying "that's close, but..."

**Demo:** Side-by-side video showing one-shot attempt vs. 4-5 turn iterative refinement on the same task. Dramatic quality difference.

---

### Module 7: The Context Starvation Diet
**Duration:** 30-35 min

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand what information AI lacks about your situation
- Build context systematically using a repeatable framework
- Recognize assumed knowledge in your own prompts

**Content:**
- What the AI doesn't know (everything about your situation)
- The curse of assumed knowledge
- Building context systematically: who, what, why, for whom, constraints
- Demo: Identical requests with minimal vs. rich context

**Bob Scenario:** Bob asks for "a presentation for the meeting" without specifying what meeting, who's attending, what they already know, what decision needs to be made, or what format is expected.

**Framework:** The Context Checklist
- WHO is this for? (audience, their knowledge level, their concerns)
- WHAT specifically do I need? (format, length, components)
- WHY does this exist? (goal, desired outcome, what success looks like)
- WHAT do I bring? (my position, existing materials, constraints)
- WHAT should it NOT be? (boundaries, things to avoid)

---

### Module 8: The Credulity Trap
**Duration:** 25-30 min

**Learning Objectives:**

**Checklist:** What to verify
- Specific facts, numbers, statistics (ALWAYS verify)
- Citations and references (often fabricated)
- Claims about current events (may be outdated or wrong)
- Technical details outside common knowledge
- Anything that would be embarrassing if wrong

---

### Module 9: The Copy-Paste Career Killer
**Duration:** 20-25 min

- Building an editing workflow

**Bob Scenario:** Bob sends an AI-written email to a client. It includes a commitment Bob can't keep and a tone that doesn't match the relationship. The client is confused and annoyed.

**Framework:** The Review Protocol
1. Read it as if a stranger wrote it (because one did)
2. Check: Does this sound like me?
3. Check: Are all facts accurate?
4. Check: Would I stake my reputation on this?
5. Edit until the answer to all three is yes

---

### Module 10: The Blame Game
**Duration:** 20-25 min

**Learning Objectives:**
- Reframe "AI is useless" from conclusion to diagnostic
- Use frustration as feedback about your input quality
- Overcome learned helplessness from previous AI disappointments

**Content:**
- "AI is useless" as a conclusion vs. a starting point
- What your frustration is actually telling you
- The feedback loop: bad output means unclear input
- Learned helplessness from Siri, Alexa, and years of disappointment

**Bob Scenario:** Bob has a folder of screenshots titled "AI Fails" that he shows colleagues to prove AI doesn't work. Every screenshot is a vague one-shot prompt.

**Reframe Exercise:** Take a "failed" interaction and diagnose what the human input lacked.
