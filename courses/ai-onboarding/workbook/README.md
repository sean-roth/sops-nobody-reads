# Workbook Companion (Future Product)

**Status:** Concept — build after course production is complete

## Concept

A set of markdown documents that function as structured prompts. The learner gives them directly to any Claude instance, which then becomes a guided tutor/coach for hands-on projects.

No platform. No app. Just markdown + Claude.

## Progression

1. **Simple research & drafting** — applying the Sixty-Second Check to real tasks
2. **Skills development** — voice definition, iteration practice, evaluation criteria
3. **Memory & context management** — teaching learners to build persistent context
4. **MCP integration** — connecting Claude to external tools and data sources
5. **Full agent workflows** — tying everything together into autonomous task completion

## Why This Works

- Zero production cost (markdown files)
- Any Claude instance has the context to support the learner
- Self-contained — no platform dependency
- Scales infinitely
- The workbook IS the practice of what the course teaches (clear writing = clear prompting)
- Later courses can build on this foundation with more advanced workbooks

## Notes

- Each workbook doc should be a complete context package: role, task, constraints, evaluation criteria
- The learner experiences firsthand what "giving the machine good context" feels like
- Progressive complexity mirrors the course structure (Part One concepts → Part Two skills → advanced)
