# AI Training Course — Full Program Roadmap

**Last Updated:** February 8, 2026

---

## The Vision

Take someone from zero AI experience to confidently orchestrating AI agents in their daily work. Three stages, each building on the last, each sellable independently or as a bundle. The full program is a complete transformation — the kind of offer businesses don't know they need until they see it.

Every stage includes a **Workbook Companion** — a set of structured prompts the learner gives to a fresh Claude instance, turning it into a guided tutor. Zero production cost, platform-independent, infinitely reusable. The workbook is how learning continues after the video content ends.

---

## Stage 1: Work With the Machine

**Audience:** Anyone. No technical background required. The universal foundation.  
**Outcome:** Learner can communicate clearly with AI, evaluate output critically, and has a reusable Working Context Document that makes every interaction sound like them.  
**Transformation:** From "write me an email" → structured, conversational AI collaboration with personal context.

### Structure

**Part One — "Why You're Failing"** (Free lead magnet, ~75 min)
- Module 1: What AI actually is (pattern machine, not mind reader)
- Module 2: What AI is not (not search, not magic, not your employee)
- Module 3: The problem is you (tacit→explicit knowledge shift)

**Part Two — "How to Actually Do It"** (Paid, ~90 min)
- Module 4: Say What You Mean (conversation, not commands; Steer/Refine/Extend)
- Module 5: Building Your Working Context Document (capstone artifact)
- Module 6: Rules of the Road (verification, hallucination, privacy, responsible use)

### Workbook Companion — Stage 1

Structured prompts for practicing with a live Claude instance:
- Guided Sixty-Second Check exercises with real tasks
- Conversation practice: first message → feedback → iteration
- Working Context Document builder (step-by-step with Claude as coach)
- Output evaluation exercises (is this right? how do I know?)
- Common mistakes identification and correction

### Value to Businesses

- Gets the entire team to baseline AI literacy fast
- Reduces "bad AI output" complaints that make people give up
- Creates consistent communication standards across the org
- The Working Context Document becomes a company asset

## Stage 2: Customize the Machine

**Audience:** Professionals who completed Stage 1 and want to go deeper. Power users, team leads, anyone who wants AI configured for their specific work.  
**Outcome:** Learner has a personalized AI environment — custom instructions, projects, persistent context, and light tool integrations that match their actual workflow.  
**Transformation:** From good conversations → a configured workspace that knows their role, their standards, and their common tasks.

### Potential Module Topics

- Claude Projects: organizing work into persistent contexts
- Custom instructions and system prompts (what to tell the machine once so you never repeat yourself)
- Skills and knowledge files: giving the machine reference material
- Introduction to tools and MCP: connecting AI to external systems (email, calendar, docs)
- Building reusable workflows: templates, checklists, and repeatable processes
- Memory and context management: what to persist, what to discard, how to keep the machine sharp
- Team configurations: setting up shared contexts for departments

### Workbook Companion — Stage 2

- Guided project setup exercises
- Custom instruction writing with iterative refinement
- Tool integration walkthroughs (connect email, connect docs, etc.)
- Workflow design templates: map your actual work → build the AI configuration
- "Audit your setup" — structured review of what's working and what's noise

### Value to Businesses

- Reduces setup time across teams (one person learns, configures for the department)
- Standardizes how AI is used within the org
- Moves from individual productivity gains to team-level efficiency
- Light automation without needing engineering resources

## Stage 3: Build With the Machine

**Audience:** Technical professionals, aspiring builders, operations leads who want full orchestration capability. The meta-skill the market is converging on.  
**Outcome:** Learner can design, build, and manage AI agent workflows — multi-step automations, code-assisted problem solving, and systems that run with human oversight.  
**Transformation:** From configured user → orchestrator who directs AI agents to complete complex, multi-step work.

### Potential Module Topics

- Agent thinking: how to decompose complex tasks into steps an agent can execute
- Claude Code / VS Code integration: working with AI in a development environment
- Multi-agent workflows: researcher → analyst → engineer patterns
- Building custom tools and integrations (MCP servers, API connections)
- Advanced memory and knowledge systems (RAG, vector stores, structured context)
- Automation design: identifying what to automate vs. what stays human
- Quality control and oversight: monitoring agent output, catching failures, maintaining standards
- Building for your team: creating agent workflows others can use

### Workbook Companion — Stage 3

- Agent workflow design exercises (map a real business process → design the agent system)
- Code-along projects with Claude Code
- Multi-agent orchestration practice
- "Build your first automation" guided project
- System audit and optimization reviews

### Value to Businesses

- Creates internal AI capability without hiring specialized engineers
- Automates repetitive workflows with human oversight
- Positions the company for the agent-native future the industry is converging on
- The orchestration skill is the meta-competency the market is demanding by late 2026/2027

## The Workbook Model

Every stage ships with a Workbook Companion — markdown files the learner gives to a fresh Claude instance to create a structured tutoring session. This is a core differentiator.

### How It Works

1. Learner opens a new Claude conversation
2. Pastes the workbook prompt for the exercise they want to practice
3. Claude becomes a guided tutor — asks questions, gives feedback, corrects mistakes, adapts to the learner's pace
4. The learner practices with their real work, not hypothetical exercises

### Why This Matters

- **Zero production cost** — it's markdown files
- **Platform-independent** — works with any Claude instance (free or paid)
- **Self-pacing** — learner goes as fast or slow as they need
- **Always current** — Claude's capabilities update automatically; the prompts stay relevant
- **Infinitely reusable** — use it once to learn, use it again when you get stuck
- **Scales to any team size** — one workbook, unlimited learners

### Progression

Stage 1 workbook: Communication fundamentals, context document building, output evaluation  
Stage 2 workbook: Configuration, workflow design, tool integration  
Stage 3 workbook: Agent design, orchestration, automation building

## Pricing Strategy (Preliminary)

### Individual / Self-Paced
- Stage 1 Part One: Free (lead magnet)
- Stage 1 Part Two: $49-99
- Stage 2: $149-299
- Stage 3: $299-499
- Full bundle (all three stages): $399-749

### Business / Team License
- Stage 1 (full): $500-1,500 per company (unlimited seats)
- Stage 2: $1,500-3,000 per company
- Stage 3: $3,000-5,000 per company
- Full program: $5,000-8,000 per company
- Custom onboarding + course delivery: priced per engagement

### Workbook-Only Option
- Individual workbook (any stage): $19-29
- All workbooks bundle: $49-69
- Low price point, high volume potential, zero marginal cost

*Pricing to be validated by market. Start with Stage 1, let client conversations inform the rest.*

## Development Priority

1. **NOW:** Finish Stage 1 (Modules 4-6 scripting, quizzes, production)
2. **NEXT:** Stage 1 Workbook Companion (markdown prompts, test with real users)
3. **LATER:** Stage 2 outline and pilot (driven by client feedback from Stage 1)
4. **FUTURE:** Stage 3 outline and pilot (driven by demand from Stage 2 completers)

Don't design Stages 2 and 3 from theory. Design them from the questions clients ask after finishing Stage 1.

## The Pitch

*"Your team is using AI whether you've trained them or not. Most of them are getting garbage output and giving up. We take them from zero to confidently working with AI in two weeks — and for the ones who want to go further, we take them all the way to building and managing AI agent workflows. No jargon. No hype. Just the skills the market is demanding right now."*
