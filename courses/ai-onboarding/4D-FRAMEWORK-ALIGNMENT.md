## The 4D Framework

Four interconnected competencies for effective, efficient, ethical, and safe AI interaction:

**DELEGATION** — Setting goals and deciding whether, when, and how to engage with AI.
- Problem Awareness: Understanding your goals and the nature of the work before involving AI
- Platform Awareness: Understanding capabilities and limitations of AI systems
- Task Delegation: Distributing work between humans and AI to leverage strengths of each

**DESCRIPTION** — Effectively communicating with AI to prompt useful outputs.
- Product Description: Defining outputs, format, audience, and style
- Process Description: Defining how the AI approaches your request
- Performance Description: Defining the AI's behavior during collaboration

**DISCERNMENT** — Accurately assessing the usefulness of AI outputs and behaviors.
- Product Discernment: Evaluating the quality of what AI produces
- Process Discernment: Evaluating how the AI arrived at its output
- Performance Discernment: Evaluating how the AI behaves during interaction

**DILIGENCE** — Taking responsibility for what we do with AI and how we do it.
- Creation Diligence: Being thoughtful about which AI systems we use and how
- Transparency Diligence: Being honest about AI's role in our work
- Deployment Diligence: Verifying and vouching for the outputs we use or share

## Key Findings from the AI Fluency Index (Feb 2026)

Study: 9,830 multi-turn Claude.ai conversations, January 2026, analyzed via Clio (privacy-preserving tool). Measured 11 of 24 behavioral indicators directly observable in conversation.

### Finding 1: Iteration Is Everything
85.7% of sampled conversations showed iteration and refinement. These conversations exhibited 2.67 additional fluency behaviors vs. 1.33 for non-iterative conversations — roughly **double the fluency rate**. Iterative conversations were:
- 5.6x more likely to involve users questioning Claude's reasoning
- 4x more likely to see users identify missing context

**Our alignment:** Module 6 (The One-Shot Catastrophe) teaches exactly this. Module 11 (Conversation Not Command) builds the habit. Our entire course structure treats iteration as the core skill, not an advanced technique.

### Finding 2: Polished Outputs Reduce Critical Evaluation
When Claude produces artifacts (code, documents, interactive tools — 12.3% of conversations):
- Users are MORE directive upfront: +14.7pp goal clarity, +14.5pp format specification, +13.4pp examples, +9.7pp iteration
- But LESS evaluative of results: -5.2pp identifying missing context, -3.7pp checking facts, -3.1pp questioning reasoning

**Our alignment:** Module 8 (The Credulity Trap) and Module 9 (Copy-Paste Career Killer) directly address this. The porcelain mask metaphor in Module 1 (slide 15) introduces this concept early: it sounds the same whether it's right or wrong.

### Finding 3: Only 30% Set Collaboration Terms
Only 30% of users tell Claude how to interact with them — defining the AI's role, requesting pushback, asking for reasoning.

**Our alignment:** Module 16 (System Prompts and Custom Instructions) teaches this explicitly. But more importantly, Modules 1-2 build the conceptual foundation that makes people WANT to set terms — you don't instruct a tool you think is a person.

## Module-to-Framework Mapping

### Part 1: Know Thy Machine (Modules 1-2) — Foundation Layer

| Module | Primary 4D Competency | Behavioral Indicators |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **M1: What Is This Thing?** | Delegation → Platform Awareness | Understanding AI capabilities/limitations, context windows, pattern completion vs. understanding. Foundational for ALL Discernment — you can't evaluate what you don't understand. |
| **M2: The Ghost in the Machine** | Delegation → Platform Awareness; Discernment → Performance Discernment | Stops anthropomorphism that blocks effective delegation. Probabilistic output understanding enables Process Discernment. |

**Strategic note:** Anthropic's course starts with similar foundations (AI Fundamentals) but we go deeper on the *emotional* implications. The wobble sequence (M1 slides 19a-19c) has no equivalent in their framework — we're teaching people to process the psychological shift, not just the facts. This is our differentiator.

### Part 2: The Prerequisites (Modules 3-5) — Delegation Competency

| Module | Primary 4D Competency | Behavioral Indicators |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **M3: The Problem Isn't the AI** | Delegation → Problem Awareness | Clarifying intent before engaging AI. The Fluency Index's "clarify goal" indicator. |
| **M4: Writing Is Thinking** | Description → Product Description | Specificity as skill. Directly maps to the Index's "specify format" and "provide examples" indicators. |
| **M5: Know Thyself** | Discernment → Product Discernment | Defining quality criteria. Can't evaluate output without knowing what good looks like. Enables the Index's "question reasoning" indicator. |

**Strategic note:** These modules address the gap the Index identified — users who are directive but not evaluative. We teach evaluation criteria BEFORE production techniques.

### Part 3: Fastest Ways to Fail (Modules 6-10) — Description + Discernment Loop

| Module | Primary 4D Competency | Behavioral Indicators |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **M6: The One-Shot Catastrophe** | Description → Process Description | Iteration as core pattern. Directly addresses the Index's #1 finding: iteration correlates with 2x fluency behaviors. |
| **M7: Context Starvation** | Description → Product + Process Description | The Context Checklist framework. Maps to "clarify goal," "specify format," "provide examples" indicators. |
| **M8: The Credulity Trap** | Discernment → Product + Process Discernment | Verification mindset. Maps to "check facts," "question reasoning," "identify missing context" indicators — the exact behaviors the Index shows DECREASE with polished outputs. |
| **M9: Copy-Paste Career Killer** | Diligence → Deployment Diligence | Review Protocol. Human accountability for AI-assisted work. |
| **M10: The Blame Game** | Delegation → Problem Awareness (meta) | Reframing failure as diagnostic. Overcomes learned helplessness that prevents all other fluency behaviors. |

### Part 4: Mental Models (Modules 11-13) — Advanced Description + Discernment

| Module | Primary 4D Competency | Behavioral Indicators |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **M11: Conversation Not Command** | Description → Process Description | "That's close, but..." as refinement tool. The behavioral embodiment of iteration. |
| **M12: Expert + Intern** | Delegation → Task Delegation | Human-AI division of labor. Domain expertise + AI capability = leverage. |
| **M13: Thinking in Drafts** | Description + Discernment (loop) | Using AI as thinking partner, not production tool. Maps to the Index's finding that augmentative use shows highest fluency. |

### Part 5: Technical Layer (Modules 14-16) — Platform Mastery

| Module | Primary 4D Competency | Behavioral Indicators |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **M14: Interface Layer** | Delegation → Platform Awareness | Feature literacy. Choosing right tool for task. |
| **M15: MCPs and Tools** | Delegation → Platform Awareness | Extended capabilities. Integration opportunities. |
| **M16: System Prompts** | Description → Performance Description | Setting collaboration terms. Directly addresses the Index's finding that only 30% of users do this. |

### Part 6: Integration (Modules 17-19) — All 4Ds Applied

| Module | Primary 4D Competency | Behavioral Indicators |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **M17: Finding Use Cases** | Delegation → Problem Awareness + Task Delegation | The AI Opportunity Audit. When to use AI, when not to. |
| **M18: Building Workflow** | All 4Ds integrated | Systematic integration. Personal workflow document as deliverable. |
| **M19: Ethics** | Diligence → All three subcategories | Data responsibility, transparency, professional accountability. Covers the 13 "non-observable" behaviors the Index couldn't measure. |

## Competitive Positioning

### vs. Anthropic Academy (AI Fluency: Framework & Foundations)
- Their course: 1.1 hours, 14 lectures, academic framework orientation
- Our course: 6-8 hours, 19 modules, narrative-driven with emotional engagement
- Their strength: Framework definition, academic credibility, free
- Our strength: Depth of application, emotional journey (the wobble), workplace-specific scenarios, Joe as recurring character, production quality (visual storytelling)
- **Positioning: Complementary, not competitive.** We operationalize what they theorize. "Anthropic defined what AI fluency looks like. We built the training that develops it."

### For HR/L&D Buyers
Sellable sentence: "This course develops all 11 observable AI fluency behaviors identified in Anthropic's February 2026 AI Fluency Index, based on the 4D Framework developed in collaboration with Anthropic, Ringling College, and University College Cork."

### For Cold Outreach
The Index finding about polished outputs reducing critical thinking is GOLD for manufacturing/operations contexts. These are environments where accepting something that "looks right" without verification has real consequences. Frame: "Anthropic's own research shows that when AI produces confident-looking output, people stop checking. Your team needs training that builds the verification habit BEFORE they start using these tools."
