# Adult Learning Principles for SOPs Nobody Reads

Distilled from adult learning theory, cognitive load research, and retention science. Only what changes output quality.

## How Adults Learn Differently

Adults are not children in bigger chairs. Key differences that affect module design:

**Self-directed.** Adults want to know WHY before HOW. Every module must establish relevance before delivering instruction. The cold open does this — it shows the problem before teaching the solution.

**Experience-based.** Adults learn by connecting new information to existing experience. Joe exists as an audience surrogate — his mistakes are ones the learner has made or will make. The learner processes "I've done that" before processing "here's why."

**Problem-centered.** Adults are motivated by solving real problems, not by accumulating knowledge. Every concept in the course connects to a practical outcome. "Pattern completion at massive scale" isn't trivia — it's the reason your emails sound generic.

**Resistant to feeling patronized.** The SOPs tone handles this by naming the difficulty honestly ("Here's the part that stings") rather than softening it ("You might find this challenging"). Adults respect directness. They distrust reassurance that feels premature.

## Cognitive Load Theory — Applied

### Three Types of Load

**Intrinsic load** — the inherent difficulty of the material. AI concepts are genuinely complex. You can't simplify them away; you manage them through sequencing.

**Extraneous load** — difficulty caused by bad presentation. Cluttered slides, jargon without definition, multiple ideas competing for attention. This is what we eliminate.

**Germane load** — the productive effort of building mental models. Analogies, examples, callbacks. This is what we maximize.

### SOPs Application

- **One idea per screen** eliminates extraneous load. The learner never has to decide which part of the slide to focus on.
- **Concrete before abstract** (show Joe's mistake, then explain why) creates germane load — the learner builds the mental model from experience to principle.
- **Named concepts** ("the fluency trap," "the context window") give the learner anchors for retrieval. A named concept is 3–5x more memorable than the same idea unnamed.
- **Slide type variation** prevents habituation. The same visual layout repeated creates autopilot; variation forces re-engagement.

## Retention Research — What Matters

### The Testing Effect

Retrieving information from memory strengthens it more than re-reading does. This is why the quiz exists — not as gatekeeping, but as a learning event. The act of answering a question about the context window reinforces the concept more than reading about it a second time.

**Implication:** Quiz questions should require genuine retrieval, not recognition. "Which of these was mentioned in the module?" is recognition. "Joe asks Claude about yesterday's conversation. Why doesn't Claude recall it?" is retrieval — the learner must reconstruct the principle from the scenario.

### Spaced Repetition

Information encountered multiple times across intervals is retained far longer than information seen once. The module structure provides this through:
- Introduction (first mention of concept)
- Application (the concept appears in Joe's story)
- Summary (concept listed in review grid)
- Quiz (concept tested through a question)

Four touches across 15–30 minutes. Not optimal spacing for long-term retention, but significantly better than a single exposure.

### The Primacy-Recency Effect

People remember the first and last things they encounter in a sequence. This is why:
- The cold open must be vivid and specific (primacy)
- The resolution scene and summary must be clean and clear (recency)
- Middle content is the danger zone — heavy concepts need extra support (variation, callbacks, permission beats) to survive the middle.

### Emotional Encoding

Information associated with emotional arousal is retained more strongly. The "existential wobble," the discomfort of "the problem is you," the recognition of "I've done exactly what Joe did" — these aren't just good storytelling. They're memory hooks. The emotional response binds the concept to the learner's autobiographical memory.

**Implication:** Don't flatten emotional moments into neutral teaching. When the script creates discomfort, protect it. Give it its own slide. Let it breathe.

## Attention Patterns

### The 10-Minute Rule (Modified)

Classic finding: adult attention drops significantly after 10 minutes of continuous input. But this applies to monotonous input. Varied input — changing visual layout, shifting emotional register, introducing a new character beat — resets the attention clock.

In a slide-based module, each slide transition is a micro-reset. The 10-minute rule becomes: don't spend more than 3–4 slides on the same emotional register without a shift. If you have four consecutive teaching slides (keypoint/concept), the next slide should be a scene, a reveal, or a permission beat.

### Pattern Interrupts

Attention is drawn to things that break patterns. This is why the options slide type (card grid) exists — it's visually distinct from everything else, forcing re-engagement. Use it when the module needs an attention reset, not just when the content happens to have options.

Similarly, the concept slide's boxed treatment creates a visual interrupt — "this is different from the slides around it, pay attention." Reserve it for genuinely important definitions, not routine points.

## Motivation

### Autonomy

Adults want to feel in control. The player's navigation (back button, progress bar, keyboard shortcuts) provides this. The quiz doesn't lock the learner out of continuing — it gates the Next button until they answer, but they can still go back.

### Competence

Adults want to feel capable. The quiz's 75% passing threshold and immediate feedback serve this — most learners will pass, confirming they understood the material. The wrong-answer feedback ("Not quite. The correct answer is highlighted above.") is neutral, not punitive.

### Relevance

Adults must believe the content matters to their actual work. Every module connects to tasks the learner does daily — writing emails, creating documents, answering questions. The course never teaches AI as an abstract subject; it teaches AI as a tool they're already using (probably badly).
