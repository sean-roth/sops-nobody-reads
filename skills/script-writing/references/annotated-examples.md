# Annotated Script Examples

Excerpts from existing SOPs Nobody Reads modules with annotations explaining why specific choices work. Reference these when drafting new scripts.

## Example 1: Cold Open — Module 1

**Script excerpt:**
```
*[SCENE: Joe is at his desk. He's been working with Claude for about twenty
minutes. Things have been going well — some back and forth, good results.
He's starting to get comfortable.]*

**JOE:** *(typing)* What did you think about that approach we discussed
yesterday? The one for the Henderson account?

*[Beat. Claude's response appears.]*

**CLAUDE:** I don't have any record of a previous conversation. Each
conversation with me starts fresh. Could you share the details of
what you discussed, and I'll be happy to help?

*[Joe stares at the screen. Not angry. Confused. He was sure they'd
talked about this.]*
```

**Why this works:**

1. **The setup is mundane.** Joe isn't doing anything dramatic — he's at his desk, twenty minutes into a work session. This is relatable to anyone who uses AI at work. Low stakes, ordinary context.

2. **The mistake is reasonable.** Joe isn't being stupid. He's been having a conversation that felt like working with a colleague. His question is natural. Every person who's used ChatGPT or Claude has had this moment or will have it.

3. **Joe's reaction is specific.** "Not angry. Confused." This is a precise emotional direction. Anger would make Joe seem unreasonable. Confusion makes him sympathetic — he genuinely doesn't understand what happened.

4. **The detail is vivid.** "The Henderson account" makes it concrete and specific. Not "the project" or "that thing" — a specific account with a name. This creates the feeling of real work, not a hypothetical.

5. **The cold open poses the question without stating it.** The module is "What Is This Thing, Anyway?" — and the cold open demonstrates why someone would ask that question. The question emerges from the scene rather than being announced.

## Example 2: The Reframe — Module 3

**Script excerpt:**
```
**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
Notice what changed between attempts. He added adjectives. Good.
Really good. Professional. Impressive. More adjectives, bigger
adjectives, stacked on top of each other like a child putting extra
candles on a birthday cake, hoping it'll make the cake taste better.

*[VISUAL: Each adjective highlights and floats off the prompt,
leaving the bare request behind.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
Now notice what *didn't* change. He never said who the email was to.
He never said what it was about. He never mentioned the proposal,
the client's concerns, the meeting last Tuesday...

He gave the machine more *decoration* and zero additional *information.*
```

**Why this works:**

1. **"Notice what changed... Now notice what didn't change."** This is the reframe structure in its purest form. The audience looks at the same evidence twice and sees something different the second time. The narrator doesn't say "you were looking at this wrong" — they guide the eye.

2. **The birthday cake analogy.** Vivid, slightly comic, slightly deflating. "Like a child putting extra candles on a birthday cake" is a risk — Sean noted in his editorial comments that it might feel condescending. But it works because the IMAGE is childlike (more candles = better taste), not the person. The analogy targets the strategy, not the strategist.

3. **"Decoration" vs "information."** The quiet thesis of this section, delivered in italics. Two words that contain the entire lesson. These are the words that will appear on the slide.

4. **The list of missing context.** "The proposal, the client's concerns, the meeting last Tuesday, the relationship they'd built over two years" — this cascade of specifics makes the absence vivid. The learner realizes how much context they carry in their head without sharing it.

## Example 3: Permission Beat — Module 1

**Script excerpt:**
```
**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
Most people, when they really understand what AI is — and isn't —
experience a wobble. A moment of "wait, what does this mean?"

This is normal. This is healthy. The wobble passes. You'll use
these tools better for having understood them.
```

**Why this works:**

1. **"A wobble."** The word choice matters enormously. Not "crisis" (too dramatic). Not "concern" (too clinical). Not "discomfort" (too generic). "Wobble" is physical, specific, slightly playful. It names an experience precisely without inflating it.

2. **Four short sentences.** "This is normal. This is healthy. The wobble passes. You'll use these tools better for having understood them." Each sentence does one thing: normalize, validate, reassure temporality, promise benefit. No padding. No elaboration. The brevity IS the comfort — it says "this doesn't need a lot of words because it's going to be fine."

3. **Placement.** This comes after the heaviest conceptual section in Module 1 (alien intelligence, no memory, no self, millions of instances). The learner has just absorbed several paradigm-shifting ideas in sequence. The permission beat arrives exactly when the cognitive/emotional load peaks.

## Example 4: Contrast Pair — Module 3

**Script excerpt:**
```
*[SCENE: Joe's desk. Same day. Different email — this one he's writing
himself. No AI. He's replying to Dave Kowalski at Pacific Ridge Supply
about a late shipment.]*

*[Joe types. Fast. No hesitation. His fingers move like he's having
a conversation.]*

...

**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
Did you see what just happened? Joe wrote a clear, effective,
well-calibrated email in under a minute. No framework. No checklist.
No conscious effort at all.
```

**Why this works:**

1. **Competence before criticism.** The module's thesis is "the problem is you." Before delivering that message, the script proves Joe is good at his job. This is structurally essential — the audience needs to respect Joe before they can learn from his mistakes. If Joe seems incompetent, the lesson is "Joe is bad at things" instead of "smart people have a specific blind spot."

2. **Physical detail.** "Joe types. Fast. No hesitation. His fingers move like he's having a conversation." This is screenwriting — showing competence through physical action rather than narrating it. The speed and ease contrast sharply with his stiff, uncertain prompting scenes.

3. **The specificity of Dave Kowalski.** Full name. Company name. Specific situation (late shipment). PO number. Install crew on-site Thursday. This isn't a generic email scene — it's a specific professional interaction with history and stakes. The specificity makes it real.

4. **The contrast is implicit.** The narrator doesn't say "notice how different this is from his AI interactions." The reader/viewer feels the difference. The narrator later makes it explicit with the split screen, but the emotional impact lands before the analysis.

## Example 5: Mythology Move — Module 1

**Script excerpt:**
```
**NARRATOR (V.O.):**
Oracles. Genies. Demons. Fairies who twist your words.

For thousands of years, humans have told stories about entities that
speak our language but don't share our nature. We thought these were
fantasies. Turns out they were practice.
```

**Why this works:**

1. **The opening list.** Four words. Four images. Each one lands with its own weight. The sentence fragments force the reader to see each one individually before the narration connects them.

2. **"We thought these were fantasies. Turns out they were practice."** This is the quiet thesis of the mythology thread. Two sentences. The first establishes what we believed; the second replaces it. The word "practice" does enormous work — it reframes ALL of mythology as rehearsal for this moment. That's a big claim delivered in a small package.

3. **Placement.** This comes right after the "alien intelligence" reveal. The learner just learned that AI is something unprecedented. The mythology move says: actually, not unprecedented. We've been here before, in our stories. This is simultaneously comforting (you have reference points) and unsettling (the fairy tales were real all along).
