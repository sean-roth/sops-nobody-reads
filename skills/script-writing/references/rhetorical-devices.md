# Rhetorical Devices — SOPs Nobody Reads

Catalog of devices used in the scripts, with annotated examples from existing modules.

## The Reframe

**What it does:** Presents what the audience believes, then replaces it with a more accurate understanding.  
**Psychological function:** Creates an information gap. The audience was wrong — now they need to know what's right. This is the engine of curiosity.

**From Module 1:**
> Not "just autocomplete." Not "a thinking machine." Both are so incomplete as to be misleading.

"Just autocomplete" is what skeptics say. "Thinking machine" is what enthusiasts say. The reframe dismisses both, positioning the narrator as someone who sees past the easy answers. The audience is now listening for the real answer.

**From Module 3:**
> The problem isn't the AI. [...] The AI did exactly what it was designed to do. It took the input it received and completed the pattern.

The audience assumed the AI was the problem. The reframe redirects blame — not to the user (which would feel accusatory) but to the INPUT. "You asked for average. You got average." This is a precise emotional calibration: the problem is fixable without the learner being broken.

**When to use:** At the top of a major teaching section. After establishing what the audience currently believes. The reframe is the pivot from "what you think" to "what's actually happening."

## The Callback

**What it does:** Returns to an earlier image, character moment, or phrase — now illuminated by new understanding.  
**Psychological function:** Creates narrative coherence. Rewards the attentive learner. Makes teaching feel like storytelling.

**From Module 1:**
> Cold open: Joe asks about yesterday's conversation. Claude doesn't remember.  
> Later: "Something in Joe's brain filed this under 'person I worked with.' He came back expecting memory. Continuity. A relationship. But there's no one there to remember."

The callback recontextualizes the opening. When we first saw Joe's confusion, it was just a moment. Now it's a case study in the fluency trap — Joe's instincts treated the AI as a person because language means person.

**From Module 3:**
> Joe writes a perfect email to Dave in 45 seconds (early in module).  
> Later: "We just watched him write a perfect email to Dave in forty-five seconds" — while he's struggling with AI.

The callback creates the contrast pair. Same person, same brain, wildly different outcomes. The learner doesn't need the narrator to explain why — the juxtaposition IS the explanation.

**When to use:** In Act 3, returning to the cold open. In mid-module, connecting a new concept to an earlier scene. Never force a callback — if it doesn't illuminate, it's just repetition.

## The Permission Beat

**What it does:** Names an emotion the learner is probably feeling and explicitly validates it.  
**Psychological function:** Defuses resistance before it forms. The learner who feels unsettled is told "that's right, keep going" instead of being left alone with discomfort.

**From Module 1:**
> "If you're feeling slightly strange, that's appropriate. Most people, when they really understand what AI is — and isn't — experience a wobble. A moment of 'wait, what does this mean?' This is normal. This is healthy. The wobble passes."

This does several things at once: (1) names the emotion without assuming everyone feels it ("if you're feeling"), (2) normalizes it ("most people"), (3) gives it a memorable name ("a wobble"), (4) promises it's temporary. The learner can now experience the wobble without anxiety about the wobble.

**From Module 3:**
> "Here's the part that stings a little." [Before revealing that the problem is the user, not the AI.]

Preemptive permission. By naming the sting before it arrives, the narrator shows awareness of the learner's experience. This builds trust — the narrator is on your side, even when delivering bad news.

**When to use:** Before or immediately after any concept that could trigger defensiveness, confusion, or existential discomfort. NOT after every concept — overuse makes the narrator seem anxious.

## The Mythology Move

**What it does:** Connects a modern technical concept to ancient human experience — myth, folklore, philosophy.  
**Psychological function:** Makes the unfamiliar feel familiar. Roots the new in the deeply known. Elevates the subject matter beyond "tech tips."

**From Module 1:**
> "Oracles. Genies. Demons. Fairies who twist your words. For thousands of years, humans have told stories about entities that speak our language but don't share our nature. We thought these were fantasies. Turns out they were practice."

This reframes AI from a 21st-century novelty to a pattern humanity has been rehearsing for millennia. The learner's unease about AI suddenly has ancient company.

**From Module 3:**
> "Two thousand years ago, at the Oracle of Delphi — you'll recall our mythology from Module 1 — two words were carved above the temple entrance. 'Know Thyself.'"

Callback to Module 1's mythology thread PLUS introduction of a new idea (self-knowledge as an AI skill). The mythology move carries thematic continuity across modules.

**When to use:** Once per module maximum. For the biggest idea, the one that needs the most weight. Overuse turns the narrator into a TED talk cliché.

## The Contrast Pair

**What it does:** Places two things side by side so the difference speaks for itself.  
**Psychological function:** The contrast IS the argument. Show, don't tell.

**From Module 3:**
> Joe typing "Write me an email" vs. all the context floating around his head. The visual contrast is the argument — look at everything you knew and didn't share.

**From Module 3:**
> The AI-generated email (polished, generic) vs. Joe's actual voice (direct, warm, specific). The learner immediately sees the difference without the narrator explaining it.

**When to use:** When the point is best made by comparison rather than explanation. When you catch yourself about to say "in contrast" or "unlike" — consider whether showing both things would be more powerful than describing the difference.

## The Quiet Thesis

**What it does:** States the most important idea in the simplest possible language, after complex exploration has earned it.  
**Psychological function:** Compression. The buildup creates pressure; the simple statement releases it. The simplicity lands BECAUSE of the complexity that preceded it.

**From Module 3:**
> [After 10+ minutes exploring why Joe's prompts fail, what tacit knowledge is, and why writing reveals thinking gaps:]  
> "Clear thinking precedes clear prompting."

Six words. They contain everything the module teaches. But they only carry that weight because the learner has spent 10 minutes understanding what "clear thinking" actually means in this context.

**From Module 1:**
> "The machine doesn't know what you don't tell it."

Simple enough to put on a sticky note. Rich enough to anchor the entire module.

**When to use:** End of Act 2 or beginning of Act 3. After the deep teaching, before the practical application. One per module. If you have two, pick the stronger one and cut the other.

## The Analogy Bridge

**What it does:** Connects an unfamiliar concept to a familiar experience through analogy.  
**Psychological function:** Transfers understanding from a known domain to an unknown one.

**From Module 3:**
> "This is like walking into a restaurant and saying 'bring me food.' When the waiter brings something you don't like, you say 'no — bring me good food.'"

Restaurants are universal. Everyone has ordered food. The analogy makes the abstract ("your prompt lacked specificity") concrete and slightly absurd — which makes it memorable.

**From Module 1:**
> "It's less like calling a person and more like consulting an infinitely patient encyclopedia. Each time you open it, it's a fresh copy."

Two analogies in one sentence: what it's NOT like (calling a person — implies relationship, memory, continuity) and what it IS like (an encyclopedia — implies knowledge without experience, freshness without memory).

**When to use:** When the concept is genuinely hard to grasp in abstract terms. Not for simple ideas — an analogy for something obvious feels condescending.
