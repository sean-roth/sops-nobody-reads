## Notes on Using This Template

- Not every section header maps 1:1 to the template. The section titles are content-specific.
- The template shows the STRUCTURE, not the length. Modules vary from 15-35 minutes.
- Joe appears in most modules but doesn't have to. Client-specific scripts may use different characters.
- The quiz always goes at the end, after the end card.
- Production notes are always the final section.
- Sean's `<!-- comments -->` can appear anywhere in the draft. They're part of the editorial process.
