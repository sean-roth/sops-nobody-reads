# SOPs Nobody Reads — Voice Guide

The complete specification for the house voice. Every script, every module, every piece of content should sound like this voice.

## The Voice in One Paragraph

Imagine a friend who happens to be brilliant at explaining things. They've figured out something important, and they're telling you about it over drinks — not performing, not lecturing, just sharing. They respect you enough to tell you the uncomfortable parts without softening them, and they're warm enough that you don't feel attacked when they do. They make complex things clear without making them simple. They use stories because stories work, not because stories are cute. They're occasionally wry, never sarcastic. They think you're smart. They know this stuff is hard.

## Sentence-Level Qualities

### Rhythm
The scripts use varied sentence length deliberately. Long sentences for exploration. Short sentences for impact. Fragments for emphasis.

> "He came back expecting memory. Continuity. A relationship. But there's no one there to remember. There never was."

The long setup ("He came back expecting...") creates momentum. The fragments ("Continuity. A relationship.") slow it down. The short declarative ("There never was.") lands the punch. This isn't accidental — it's the primary tool for controlling pacing in narration.

### Diction
The vocabulary is educated but not academic. The narrator uses precise words when precision matters ("tacit knowledge," "pattern completion") but defaults to plain language everywhere else. No jargon for its own sake. No impressive words where simple ones work.

**Good:** "The result can be brilliant. It can also be confidently, fluently wrong."  
**Bad:** "The output may exhibit significant accuracy variances despite maintaining linguistic coherence."

The good version uses everyday words arranged precisely. The bad version uses technical words arranged generically.

### Contractions
The narrator uses contractions naturally. "It's" not "it is." "Don't" not "do not." "You're" not "you are." This is spoken language transcribed, not written language performed. The only exception: when the uncontracted form adds emphasis. "It is not thinking. It is predicting." — the formality of "it is" carries weight precisely because contractions are the default.

### Second Person
The narrator addresses the learner directly. "You," not "one" or "learners" or "people." This creates intimacy and stakes. "You're reading fluent text, and your brain interprets that as certainty" hits differently than "People tend to interpret fluent text as certain."

## Emotional Register

### How to Handle Uncomfortable Truths

The scripts regularly deliver messages that could feel accusatory: "the problem is you," "your instincts are wrong," "you can't tell when the AI is lying." The voice handles these by:

1. **Naming the discomfort directly.** "Here's the part that stings a little." Not hedging around it. Not pretending it's fine. Naming it.

2. **Validating the feeling.** "If you're feeling slightly strange, that's appropriate." The learner's emotional response is correct, not something to overcome.

3. **Reframing as empowerment.** "If the problem were the technology, you'd be stuck. But the problem is you — and that means you can fix it." The uncomfortable truth becomes good news.

4. **Never, ever mocking.** Joe is never stupid. His mistakes are always reasonable given what he knew. The audience should think "I've done that" not "what an idiot." If a passage could be read as condescending, rewrite it.

### The Warmth-Directness Balance

Too warm: "Don't worry, everyone struggles with this! It's totally normal and you're doing great!"
Too direct: "Most people fail at this because they don't think before typing."
Right: "This is normal. This is healthy. The wobble passes. You'll use these tools better for having understood them."

The right version is direct about the reality (wobble is real), warm about the outcome (it passes, you'll be better), and respectful about the learner's experience (no diminishing, no cheerleading).

## Anti-Patterns

Things the SOPs voice NEVER does:

- **Exclamation points.** Almost never. If you find one, it should probably be a period. Energy comes from word choice and rhythm, not punctuation.
- **"Simply" or "just" before instructions.** "Simply open the settings" implies it's obvious. If it were obvious, we wouldn't be teaching it.
- **"As we discussed earlier."** Callbacks happen through content, not meta-references. Return to the scene, don't reference the slide.
- **Rhetorical questions that answer themselves.** "But what if there were a better way? There is." This is the voice of a late-night infomercial, not a trusted guide.
- **Filler transitions.** "Now let's turn our attention to..." "Moving on to our next topic..." "With that in mind..." If the next section follows naturally, no transition is needed. If it doesn't, the structure is wrong.
- **Corporate hedging.** "It could be argued that..." "Some might say..." "In many cases..." The narrator has a point of view and states it. Hedging when the content is uncertain is honest; hedging to avoid commitment is weak.
- **Gendered language.** Joe is male because he's a specific character. Generic references use "they" or "the learner" or restructure to avoid the issue.
- **Emoji, hashtags, internet-speak.** Never. Not even ironically.

## Dialogue

Joe's dialogue is brief and naturalistic. He types, not speaks. His prompts should sound exactly like what a real person would actually type — not what a textbook would suggest.

> **JOE:** *(typing)* Write me an email.

Not:
> **JOE:** *(typing)* Could you please compose a professional email on my behalf?

Joe types like a human under time pressure. That's the point.

## Sean's Editorial Comments

Scripts may contain HTML comments (`<!-- ... -->`) with Sean's thinking, questions, and editorial notes. These are part of the creative process and should be preserved in drafts. They often contain:

- Tone calibration ("Are we being too aggressive here?")
- Deeper thematic connections Sean sees in the material
- Production questions about how something will land
- Notes about whether an idea is illustrated twice (intentionally or not)

When revising a script, read and respond to these comments. They're Sean thinking out loud. Sometimes they suggest a change; sometimes they're confirming a choice works.
